# Using `addLeverageFromTkn` is impossible in a certain case

### Summary

Using `addLeverageFromTkn` is impossible when the token in a pod is USDT.

NOTE that USDT as a token in a pod is completely possible and __expected__. According to the docs:
>Peapods provides users with the tools required to farm volatility and earn yield on any liquid asset. With Peapods, users can wrap any one or more liquid assets into a single ERC-20 token.

As seen, users are expected to create pods for __ANY__ liquid asset which USDT clearly is one of.

### Root Cause

Upon using `addLeverageFromTkn` to convert a token to a pod, we have this code:
```solidity
_tkn.approve(_pod, _tkn.balanceOf(address(this)) - _tknBalBefore);
IDecentralizedIndex(_pod).bond(address(_tkn), _tkn.balanceOf(address(this)) - _tknBalBefore, _amtPtknMintMin);
```
The issue is the `.approve()` on tokens such as USDT as USDT does not return a boolean which the IERC20 interface expects. This will cause the function to always revert.
