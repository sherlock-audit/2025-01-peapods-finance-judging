# `deadline` not implemented in `addLPAndStake()`

### Summary

The missing deadline check in addLPAndStake will cause gas waste and fund lockup for users as network congestion will allow transactions to execute after the deadline expires.

### Root Cause

In `addLPAndStake` ([code link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/IndexUtils.sol#L51-L102)), the `_deadline` parameter is not validated before token transfers and _zap operations. This allows transactions to proceed with expired deadlines, wasting gas and locking funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Users must submit transactions with a _deadline that could expire before mining 


### External Pre-conditions

Ethereum network congestion causes delayed transaction mining (e.g., during peak usage or MEV activity).

### Attack Path

1. User submits addLPAndStake with `_deadline = block.timestamp + 10 minutes`.
2. Network congestion delays transaction mining by 15 minutes.
3. Token transfers and _zap operations execute, but addLiquidityV2 reverts due to an expired deadline.
4. User’s tokens are locked in the contract until manually refunded.

### Impact

1. Users suffer gas waste (500k gas ≈ $50) and temporary loss of access to transferred tokens.
2. Protocol accumulates dust tokens, complicating accounting and creating potential attack surfaces.

### PoC

Alice’s Action:

Alice calls addLPAndStake with `_deadline = block.timestamp + 10 minutes` (valid for 10 minutes).

She sends 100 IDX tokens and 1 ETH to the contract.

Network Congestion:

Due to high gas prices or MEV activity, Alice’s transaction is delayed and mined 15 minutes later (5 minutes after the deadline expires).

Transaction Execution:

The contract transfers Alice’s tokens and executes `_zap` (if needed).

When calling `addLiquidityV2`, the DEX handler checks the deadline and reverts because `block.timestamp > _deadline`.

Aftermath:

Alice’s 100 IDX tokens and 1 ETH are stuck in the contract until she manually calls a refund function.

She loses gas fees (~50–100) for the failed transaction.

Alice’s funds are temporarily locked, and she incurs unnecessary gas costs.

The protocol’s UX suffers, as users lose trust in transaction reliability.
