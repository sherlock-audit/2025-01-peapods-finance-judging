# liquidate()

 **the `liquidate()` function can end up writing off (i.e. "adjusting away") a borrower’s remaining debt while at the same time transferring *all* of their collateral to the liquidator**, even if the liquidator has only repaid *part* of the total debt.

### Where the issue appears

In `_liquidate()`, there is logic to handle "clean" vs. "dirty" liquidations:

```solidity
// ...
// We first optimistically calculate the amount of collateral to give the liquidator based on the higher clean liquidation fee
uint256 _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator =
    (_totalBorrow.toAmount(_sharesToLiquidate, false) * _exchangeRate) / EXCHANGE_PRECISION
    * (LIQ_PRECISION + cleanLiquidationFee)
/ LIQ_PRECISION;

// leftoverCollateral = total userCollateral - that "optimistic" amount
int256 _leftoverCollateral = (userCollateralBalance[_borrower].toInt256()
    - _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator.toInt256());

// If leftoverCollateral <= 0, the code treats it as a “clean” liquidation ...
if (_leftoverCollateral <= 0) {
    // ... forcibly “adjust away” the rest of the borrower’s debt:
    _sharesToAdjust = _borrowerShares - _sharesToLiquidate;
    if (_sharesToAdjust > 0) {
        _amountToAdjust = (_totalBorrow.toAmount(_sharesToAdjust, false)).toUint128();
        _totalBorrow.amount -= _amountToAdjust;
        totalAsset.amount -= _amountToAdjust;
    }
}

// Then the protocol repays `_sharesToLiquidate + _sharesToAdjust`.
_repayAsset(
    _totalBorrow,
    _amountLiquidatorToRepay,
    _sharesToLiquidate + _sharesToAdjust,
    msg.sender,
    _borrower
);

// And transfers all borrower collateral to the liquidator if “clean” ...
_removeCollateral(_collateralForLiquidator, msg.sender, _borrower);
```

Observe the critical part:

1. **Liquidator only repays `_sharesToLiquidate`**.  
2. If `_leftoverCollateral <= 0`, the contract treats it as a full liquidation and sets  
   ```solidity
   _sharesToAdjust = _borrowerShares - _sharesToLiquidate;
   ```  
   meaning the protocol simply “writes off” (`_adjust`) whatever remaining borrow shares the borrower had.

3. At the same time, `_collateralForLiquidator` is set to **all** of the borrower’s collateral (`userCollateralBalance[_borrower]`).

In effect, if there is *any* shortfall in collateral (which can happen for many reasons: price movement, interest accrued, etc.) that leads `_leftoverCollateral` to be slightly below zero, the liquidator is allowed to grab **all** borrower collateral while only paying down a partial chunk (`_sharesToLiquidate`) of the borrower's debt. The remainder of the debt (`_sharesToAdjust`) simply gets “written off” by the protocol.

This can be *intended* in a strict "full wipeout" scenario—when a position is truly underwater, the protocol may choose to eat the difference. But, **the code triggers that same "clean liquidation" path even if the liquidator is *not* repaying all the debt**—it just checks `leftoverCollateral <= 0`. In that case, the protocol effectively under-collects from the borrower’s debt while overpaying the liquidator.

### Why it matters

- From the protocol’s standpoint, you typically only want to write off (adjust) the remaining debt if a liquidator truly *covers* all outstanding shares (i.e. a full repay).  
- From the liquidator’s standpoint, the code potentially lets them repay just a fraction of the debt (the `_sharesToLiquidate` part), but still walk away with **all** of the user’s collateral if `_leftoverCollateral` dips below zero.  
- From the borrower’s standpoint, all their collateral disappears—even though the protocol only got a partial repayment from the liquidator.  

Hence, the net effect can cause a loss to the protocol. It is especially noticeable in edge cases where the leftover collateral is *slightly* below zero (or just barely negative). 
Overview of the Attack Idea
	•	The contract’s liquidation logic confuses the judgment of “whether the remaining collateral covers all of the debt” with “whether the liquidator has actually repaid all of the remaining debt.”
	•	If the calculated “remaining collateral” (borrower’s collateral minus the collateral corresponding to the liquidation share) becomes less than or equal to zero (_leftoverCollateral <= 0), it is treated as a “clean liquidation.”
	•	“Clean liquidation” triggers a direct write-off (using _sharesToAdjust to wipe out the remaining debt). However, during this process, the liquidator only needs to repay a portion of the debt (_sharesToLiquidate), but they get to take all of the borrower’s collateral.
	•	The protocol effectively absorbs the loss for the remaining debt because the part of the debt written off wasn’t actually repaid by the liquidator.

Attack Path (Example Scenario)

Here is a hypothetical attack scenario. Actual values depend on interest rates, collateral prices, collateral amounts, borrowed amounts, etc., but the approach remains similar:
	1.	Borrower has collateral and debt:
	•	Assume the borrower has deposited some collateral (userCollateralBalance[borrower]) into the contract and borrowed an asset with corresponding debt (userBorrowShares[borrower]).
	•	Due to price fluctuations, interest accrual, etc., the borrower’s collateral value becomes insufficient to fully cover their debt, but the deficit is not substantial yet.
	2.	Collateral is “slightly insufficient” to fully cover:
	•	After updating the exchange rate (_exchangeRate) and interest, the contract calculates:
	If part of the debt (e.g., 30%) is liquidated, considering the liquidation fee (clean fee), theoretically, it should just about consume all of the borrower’s collateral.
	•	Therefore, _leftoverCollateral = User's remaining collateral - “collateral to be taken for this liquidation portion” might result in a slightly negative value.
	3.	Attacker (Liquidator) chooses to repay only part of the debt:
	•	The liquidator calls liquidate(_sharesToLiquidate, ...) and intentionally repays only part of the debt (e.g., 30% of the total debt).
	•	In the function, this _sharesToLiquidate is converted to _amountLiquidatorToRepay asset (less than the total debt).
	4.	Code treats this as a “clean liquidation”:
	•	Since _leftoverCollateral <= 0, the contract logic proceeds with:
```solidity
if (_leftoverCollateral <= 0) {
    // Treat it as full liquidation
    // Write off the remaining debt shares for the borrower
    _sharesToAdjust = _borrowerShares - _sharesToLiquidate;
    ...
}
```

The contract writes off the remaining _sharesToAdjust (i.e., 70% of the debt) in one go (_totalBorrow.amount -= _amountToAdjust),
meaning the protocol waives that portion of the debt.

5.	Liquidator takes all of the borrower’s collateral:
	In the subsequent logic, the contract transfers userCollateralBalance[borrower] (the entire collateral) to the liquidator (or most of it, leaving a tiny bit for the protocol as a fee), because it is treated as a complete liquidation, meaning all collateral goes to the liquidator.
	In reality, the liquidator only repaid the portion corresponding to _sharesToLiquidate.
6.	Protocol absorbs the remaining loss:
	The remaining 70% of the debt is not repaid by anyone and is written off by _sharesToAdjust.
	This results in a loss to the protocol. If the loss is significant, it could affect the capital providers (the liquidity providers).

Why Does the “All Collateral Taken” Happen?

In the code above, the logic distinguishing “clean liquidation” and “dirty liquidation” relies on:
```solidity
_leftoverCollateral = borrowerCollateral - optimisticCollateralForLiquidator;
if (_leftoverCollateral <= 0) {
    // Clean liquidation (take all collateral and write off remaining debt)
} else {
    // Dirty liquidation (take part of the collateral, leaving some for the borrower)
}
```
Once _leftoverCollateral <= 0, even if it’s only a “slightly negative value,” the code automatically enters the “clean liquidation” branch, and it does not check whether the liquidator has actually repaid all of the remaining debt.
Therefore, the liquidator just needs to “engineer” a situation where _leftoverCollateral is slightly negative, and they can take all collateral while only repaying part of the debt.
