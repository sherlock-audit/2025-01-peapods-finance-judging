# Users will lose rewards when shares change during reward token pause period

### Summary

The incorrect handling of paused reward tokens in `TokenRewards.sol` will cause a loss of rewards for users who have share changes during the pause period, as their excluded rewards are reset without distributing the pending rewards.

### Root Cause

In [`TokenRewards.sol:_resetExcluded()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L258-L263) the function unconditionally updates the excluded rewards for all reward tokens, including paused ones, without accounting for pending paused rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. One of whitelisted reward tokens is deposited to the contract to be distributed
2. The owner of `RewardsWhitelister` contract pauses and unpauses the reward token

### External Pre-conditions

Shares of a user changes, either by staking or unstaking.

### Attack Path

1. Alice stakes 100pTkn and receives 100spTkn, thus increasing 100 shares on `TokenRewards`
2. Assume there's 1000 total shares on `TokenRewards`
3. `USDC` token is whitelisted and 1000 USDC is deposited to the contract, which makes 100 USDC for Alice
4. The owner of `RewardsWhitelister` contract pauses the `USDC` token for some reason
5. A malicious user Bob stakes 1 wei of pTkn for Alice, thus making changes to her shares
6. `USDC` token is unpaused and Alice unstakes her 100spTkn, thus decreasing her shares by 100
7. Alice didn't receive any rewards, and those lost rewards remain locked in the contract

### Impact

Users will lose rewards when shares changes during the reward token pause period, either by natural behavior or by malicious actions.

### PoC

```solidity
    function test_audit_pausedRewardsToken() public {
        // Whitelist secondary reward token
        rewardsWhitelister.toggleRewardsToken(address(secondaryRewardToken), true);

        assertEq(tokenRewards.totalShares(), 0);

        address alice = address(0xa11ce);

        // Alice stakes 100Tkn and receives 100spTkn, thus increasing 100 shares on TokenRewards
        vm.prank(address(trackingToken));
        tokenRewards.setShares(alice, 100e18, false);

        assertEq(tokenRewards.shares(alice), 100e18);
        assertEq(tokenRewards.totalShares(), 100e18);
        
        // Distribute secondary rewards
        uint256 secondaryRewards = 1000e18;
        tokenRewards.depositRewards(address(secondaryRewardToken), secondaryRewards);

        // Assume, secondary tokens is paused
        rewardsWhitelister.setPaused(address(secondaryRewardToken), true);

        // Bob stakes 10Tkn for Alice, thus increasing her shares by 10
        vm.prank(address(trackingToken));
        tokenRewards.setShares(alice, 110e18, false);

        // Later, secondary token is unpaused
        rewardsWhitelister.setPaused(address(secondaryRewardToken), false);

        // Alice unstakes her 100spTkn, thus decreasing shares by 100
        vm.prank(address(trackingToken));
        tokenRewards.setShares(alice, 100e18, true);

        // Alice didn't receive secondary rewards
        assertEq(secondaryRewardToken.balanceOf(alice), 0);
    }
```
To test this, you can put the code in `TokenRewards.t.sol`, and run it with `forge test --match-test test_audit_pausedRewardsToken`.

The `TokenRewards.t.sol` was using `MockRewardsWhitelister`, but you need to replace it with the actual `RewardsWhitelister` contract.

### Mitigation

I can suggest two different types of mitigations:

1. In `_resetExcluded()` function, check if the reward token is paused, and if so, don't update the excluded amount for wallets that had shares in the past.
2. Calculate the pending amounts that should be distributed, and update the pending amounts for paused tokens in `_distributeRewards()` function.
