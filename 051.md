# Accounting Errors in whitelistWithdraw and whitelistDeposit Functions

### Summary

The **whitelistWithdraw** and **whitelistDeposit** functions contain accounting mistakes that can lead to incorrect tracking of vault balances, which may cause over-withdrawals, misreported deposits, or incorrect utilization values.

**Severity:** High
**Impact:** High
**Likelihood:**  High

**whitelistWithdraw function:**
```solidity
vaultDeposits[_vault] += _assetAmt;
vaultUtilization[_vault] += _assetAmt;
_totalAssetsUtilized += _assetAmt;
```
**whitelistDeposit function:**
```solidity
vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _assetAmt > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultDeposits[_vault] : _assetAmt;
vaultUtilization[_vault] -= _assetAmt;
_totalAssetsUtilized -= _assetAmt;
```

### Description of Issue
The `whitelistWithdraw` and `whitelistDeposit` functions contain accounting errors that could result in incorrect tracking of vault balances, potentially causing over-withdrawals, incorrect deposit amounts, and inaccurate utilization values.

**Issues Identified:**
1. **whitelistWithdraw:**

When assets are withdrawn, the deposit balance and utilization are both *incorrectly increased*.
There is *no check to ensure the vault has sufficient assets* for withdrawal, leading to the risk of over-withdrawals.

2. **whitelistDeposit:**

*Faulty logic* in the subtraction of the deposit balance, leading to incorrect deposit values.
The vault's utilization and total assets utilized are incorrectly *decreased* when assets are deposited, which misrepresents the vault's actual asset usage.

### Impacts
- **Incorrect Balances:** Misreported deposits and utilization can lead to vault imbalances.
- **Financial Risk:** Over-withdrawals or misreported deposits can disrupt vault functionality and affect liquidity.
- **System Integrity:** The errors could propagate through other parts of the system, leading to further failures.

### Likelihood Explanation
- **High Likelihood:** These errors can easily occur during normal operations, especially with frequent deposits and withdrawals. If triggered, they will propagate throughout the system, causing further issues.

### Recommendation:
1. **Fix whitelistWithdraw:**

- Decrease the deposit balance when withdrawing.
- Increase utilization since the assets are being used.
- Add validation to ensure the vault has enough assets for the withdrawal.
```solidity
vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _assetAmt; // Decrease deposits when withdrawing
vaultUtilization[_vault] += _assetAmt; // Increase utilization since assets are being used
_totalAssetsUtilized += _assetAmt; // Increase total assets utilized
```
2. **Fix whitelistDeposit:**

- Increase the deposit balance when assets are deposited.
- Decrease utilization to reflect the return of assets.
- Update the total assets utilized correctly.
```solidity
vaultDeposits[_vault] += _assetAmt; // Increase deposits when vault returns assets
vaultUtilization[_vault] -= _assetAmt; // Decrease utilization since assets are returned
_totalAssetsUtilized -= _assetAmt; // Decrease total assets utilized
```
### Final Correct Code
✅ `whitelistWithdraw` (Decrease `vaultDeposits`, Increase Utilization)
```solidity

function whitelistWithdraw(uint256 _assetAmt) external override onlyWhitelist {
    address _vault = _msgSender();
    _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);

    require(totalAvailableAssetsForVault(_vault) >= _assetAmt, "MAX");

    vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _assetAmt; // ✅ Decrease deposits when withdrawing
    vaultUtilization[_vault] += _assetAmt; // ✅ Increase utilization since assets are being used
    _totalAssetsUtilized += _assetAmt; // ✅ Increase total assets utilized

    IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_vault, _assetAmt);
    emit WhitelistWithdraw(_vault, _assetAmt);
}
```
✅ `whitelistDeposit` (Increase `vaultDeposits`, Decrease Utilization)
```solidity

function whitelistDeposit(uint256 _assetAmt) external override onlyWhitelist {
    address _vault = _msgSender();
    _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);

    vaultDeposits[_vault] += _assetAmt; // ✅ Increase deposits when vault returns assets
    vaultUtilization[_vault] -= _assetAmt; // ✅ Decrease utilization since assets are returned
    _totalAssetsUtilized -= _assetAmt; // ✅ Decrease total assets utilized

    IERC20(_asset).safeTransferFrom(_vault, address(this), _assetAmt);
    emit WhitelistDeposit(_vault, _assetAmt);
}
```
### Final Confirmation:
✅ **Withdraw** → Decrease deposits, Increase utilization
✅ **Deposit** → Increase deposits, Decrease utilization
