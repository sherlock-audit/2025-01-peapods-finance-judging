# Pre-Swap Fee Mechanism Causes Forced Price Impact, Leading to Potential DoS on DEX Sell Orders

### Summary

In the [_update function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L159-L182), when a user sells tokens on the DEX, the contract has the potential to first swaps up to 1% of the liquidity pool (LP) balance before processing the trade. This swap is triggered inside [_processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L185-L212), which [sells tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L232) from the contract’s balance into the LP, impacting the token’s market price.

This forced swap mechanism artificially reduces the price before the user’s sell order is executed, resulting in:
- Increased slippage and worse execution prices for traders.
- Potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) for large sell orders.
- MEV exploitation.


Trade Classification & Swap Trigger:
If [_to == V2_POOL](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L165), the function recognizes a sell order.
The [_processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L185) function is called before executing the user’s trade.

Forced Pre-Swap Calculation
- The contract calculates a max swap amount as 1% of the LP balance:
```solidity
uint256 _lpBal = balanceOf(V2_POOL);
uint256 _min = block.chainid == 1 ? _lpBal / 1000 : _lpBal / 4000; // 0.1% or 0.025% LP
uint256 _max = _lpBal / 100; // 1% LP balance
```

If the contract balance exceeds [_max](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L203), it swaps _max before executing the user’s trade.
The forced swap reduces the LP’s reserves, causing a drop in price before the user’s trade.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the design choice to use 1% of the LP balance as the max swap amount in `_processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()` impacts traders that performs sell order on DEX

### Impact

The automatic swap of up to 1% of pool liquidity creates significant price impact causes:
- Increased slippage and worse execution prices for traders.
- Potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) for large sell orders.
- MEV exploitation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reduce Maximum Swap Size from 1%
