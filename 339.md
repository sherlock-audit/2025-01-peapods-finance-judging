# Liquidators Will Not Get Their Bonus Collateral or Lose Money When they Liquidate

### Summary

The missing check for whether the `cleanLiquidationFee` or `dirtyLiquidationFee` is included in the final amount of collateral transferred to the liquidator causes the liquidators to get less fees than they were promised, or in some cases actually come to a net negative balance by getting `0%` fees. 

### Root Cause

The [`liquidate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1100) function allows a third party to repay a borrower's debt if they have become insolvent. The liquidators get paid a percentage of collateral as fees when they liquidate the position as a bonus: 
```solidity 
function liquidate(uint128 _sharesToLiquidate, uint256 _deadline, address _borrower)
       ...

  uint256 _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator =
@>    (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + cleanLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;
  
  _leftoverCollateral = (_userCollateralBalance.toInt256() - _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator.toInt256());
  
  _collateralForLiquidator = _leftoverCollateral <= 0
    ? _userCollateralBalance
@>    : (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + dirtyLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;
  
  if (protocolLiquidationFee > 0) {
    _feesAmount = (protocolLiquidationFee * _collateralForLiquidator) / LIQ_PRECISION;
    _collateralForLiquidator = _collateralForLiquidator - _feesAmount;
```

This bonus is calculated as either the `cleanLiquidationFee` or the `dirtyLiquidationFee` (as shown above) depending on whether the liquidator liquidates the entire position or only a partial position. 

The problem lies in the snippet of lines below (taken from the function above): 
```solidity
  _collateralForLiquidator = _leftoverCollateral <= 0
@>    ? _userCollateralBalance
    : (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + dirtyLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;
```

If the `_leftoverCollateral <= 0`, then the `_collateralForLiquidator` is set to the `_userCollateralBalance`. This is done to ensure that if the liquidator is performing a full liquidation, then they should get all the collateral the borrower has. But, this is where the liquidator might be underpaid for their liquidations. If the entire position of the borrower is less than the sum of underlying collateral and the bonus collateral, the liquidator suffers a loss. 

The function does not make any adjustments to the amount of loan tokens the liquidator needs to pay back in case the entire collateral of the borrower is unable to pay the bonus collateral. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `maxLTV` of a Pair is set to `100 - maxLTV â‰² liquidationFees`. 
2. Borrower takes out a loan. 
3. Borrower's loan becomes insolvent.
4. Liquidator calls the liquidation but get less amount of bonus collateral than specified by the protocol. 

### External Pre-conditions

1. The borrower's loan becomes insolvent due to various external factors.

### Attack Path

Take the following situation as an example: 
* A loan's `maxLTV` is `95%`, and the `cleanLiquidationFee` is `6%`. 
* The loan while being liquidated has `100` assets, and `105.26` collateral. For simplicity, let's say that the exchange rate is `1:1`. 
* This gives `LTV = 95%`. This will trigger liquidation. 

While the position is being liquidated, the following code will trigger: 
```solidity
uint256 _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator = (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + cleanLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;
```

Which will give: $100 * 1.06 = 106$. 
So, they deserve `106` collateral (which includes the bonus fee) for liquidating the entire position. 

The following code will then trigger: 
```solidity 
_leftoverCollateral = (_userCollateralBalance.toInt256() - _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator.toInt256());

_collateralForLiquidator = _leftoverCollateral <= 0 ? _userCollateralBalance : (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + dirtyLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;
```

The `_collateralForLiquidator` will be set to `_userCollateralBalance` because this will be a full liquidation. So, the liquidator gets transferred the `_userCollateralBalance`. 

So, in summary the liquidator will see the following: 
* They transfer in `100` assets, and get `105.26` collateral back. 
* They were promised a `6%` bonus when they agreed to liquidate, which should come out to `106` collateral. 
* Hence, they suffered a $6 - 5.26 = 0.74$% loss. (Note: $(105.26-100)/100 = 5.26%$)

`0.74%` loss is a noticeable amount of loss for the liquidator. 

Now, let's consider if a position has a maxLTV of `100%`. This means that the liquidator will get `0%` bonus and actually lose money due to gas costs.

### Impact

The liquidators are promised a percentage of collateral bonus when they agree to liquidate a position. This is not true in certain situations, and their loss will be higher than `0.1%` up to the total bonus rate being the highest amount of loss possible (example, if the liquidation bonus is 10%, they might have a maximum of 10% loss).
