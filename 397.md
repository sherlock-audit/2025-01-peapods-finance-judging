# Swapping `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` with a 5% is too much

### Summary

The slippage check is 5% in `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()`, which is enough for a bot to snipe it and cause a loss to the protocol with 3-5% 
 in a sandwich attack.

### Root Cause

`_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` uses 5% slippage which in my opinion is too much and is certainly enough for it to be sniped and cause a loss of funds to the protocol. [Here's the slippage setting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L318-L320) - this is obviously excessive and should be less than 5% in order to ensure manageable losses like 0.2-0.5% and not 5%.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A bot needs to me online to snipe

### External Pre-conditions

Medium sized trades happening

### Attack Path

1. `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` is called to initiate the swap between paired token and pod token
2. Bot sees the opportunity and snipes the transaction moving the price 4.5%
3. `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` is still going to execute, because its tolerance is 5%, but this is enough for a high severity due to Sherlock rules
4. Trade is executed, but due to the excessive slippage, the trade occured at a loss of between 4 and 4.5%

### Impact

Loss of funds due to the excessive slippage

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Create a more restrictive slippage so that the trade is not profitable for sniping
