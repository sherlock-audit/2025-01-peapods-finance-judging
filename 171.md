# `addInterest` will not update the interest acurately which would enable users to claim rewards for time that they weren't staked inside `LendingAssetVault`

### Summary

Users would be able to deposit into `LendingAssetVault` and earn interest on the frax lend pair that was generated before they deposited, i.e. claiming rewards for time that they weren't there. This can be further exploited by MEV bots.

This is due to `_updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults` updating on **rate** changes, rather than **share value** ones.

### Root Cause

Notice that there is a difference between the original frax code and the one we have. The difference is that interest is not always added, which would later lead to the issue described bellow:

https://github.com/FraxFinance/fraxlend/blob/main/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L279-L298
```solidity
    function addInterest(...) {
        (, _interestEarned, _feesAmount, _feesShare, _currentRateInfo) = _addInterest();
        if (_returnAccounting) {
            _totalAsset = totalAsset;
            _totalBorrow = totalBorrow;
        }
    }
```

When we deposit we first call `_updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults` to update the interest

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L106-L110
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(address(0));

        // assets * 1e27 / _cbr
        _shares = convertToShares(_assets);

        _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
    }
```

`_updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults` loop trough all of the vault and calls `addInterest` on each one of them.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L204-L216
```solidity
    function _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(address _vaultToExclude) internal {
        uint256 _l = _vaultWhitelistAry.length;

        for (uint256 _i; _i < _l; _i++) {
            address _vault = _vaultWhitelistAry[_i];
            if (_vault == _vaultToExclude) {
                continue;
            }

            (uint256 _interestEarned,,,,,) = IFraxlendPair(_vault).addInterest(false);
            if (_interestEarned > 0) {
                _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
            }
        }
    }
```

Where `addInterest` would add interest only if the new `_rateChange` is at least 0.1% bigger than the old one:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L286-L325
```solidity
        if (
            _currentUtilizationRate != 0
                && _rateChange < _currentUtilizationRate * minURChangeForExternalAddInterest / UTIL_PREC // 0.1%
        ) {
            emit SkipAddingInterest(_rateChange);
            
        } else {
            (, _interestEarned, _feesAmount, _feesShare, _currentRateInfo) = _addInterest();
        }
```

However the issue is in how we calculate it. As we use `totalAsset`, `totalBorrow` and the assets inside our `LendingAssetVault`. However both `totalAsset`, `totalBorrow` were last updated when there was a deposit, withdraw, borrow, etc... and back then the interest was accrued. Meaning that the only "fresh" value we have are the assets inside our `LendingAssetVault`, where this call started, and if they were not updated (no deposits/withdraws) then all of the values we used for interest would be outdated.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L286-L325
```solidity
    function addInterest(...) external nonReentrant {
        _currentRateInfo = currentRateInfo;

        uint256 _currentUtilizationRate = _prevUtilizationRate;
        uint256 _totalAssetsAvailable = totalAsset.totalAmount(address(externalAssetVault));
        uint256 _newUtilizationRate = _totalAssetsAvailable == 0 
            ? 0 
            // (1e5 * totalBorrow.amount) / _totalAssetsAvailable
            : (UTIL_PREC * totalBorrow.amount) / _totalAssetsAvailable;

        uint256 _rateChange = _newUtilizationRate > _currentUtilizationRate
            ? _newUtilizationRate - _currentUtilizationRate
            : _currentUtilizationRate - _newUtilizationRate;

        if (
            _currentUtilizationRate != 0
                && _rateChange < _currentUtilizationRate * minURChangeForExternalAddInterest / UTIL_PREC // 0.1%
        ) {
            emit SkipAddingInterest(_rateChange);
            
        } else {
            (, _interestEarned, _feesAmount, _feesShare, _currentRateInfo) = _addInterest();
        }
    }
```

In short this means that we are trying to calculate the new interest change with values that were changed with the last update on interest and never touched afterwards. This of course will lead to the interest being unchanged, as for the only  way `totalBorrow.amount` and `totalAsset.amount` to increase is if there were any interactions or interest updates.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. There are no interactions (deposit/withdraw/borrow) with frax lend for a few hours or days
2. User deposits, but `_updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults` doesn't update the interest 


Now the user can deposits another small amount or performs any other auction that will trigger `_updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults` to update the interest on all of the vaults, which is possible as the deposit increased `_totalAssets`, which the vault tracks

The user ca just withdraw, the withdraw will update the interest and thus increase the share value.

### Impact

User has claimed rewards for time that he was not staked. This will happen regularly, where the amounts can range from dust to some reasonable MEV money (a couple of bucks).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Rely on `previewAddInterest` for if the interest should be worth changing as it would us current numbers and perform the actual math thanks to `_calculateInterest`.

```solidity
        _newCurrentRateInfo = currentRateInfo;
        // Write return values
        InterestCalculationResults memory _results = _calculateInterest(_newCurrentRateInfo);
```
