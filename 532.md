# `_swapForRewards` failures can be gamed to earn more rewards

### Summary

When a swap fails during the `TokenRewards.depositFromPairedLpToken` process, the `_rewardsPerShare` will not be updated until the swap is successful later. This means that users can take advantage of this and stake when they know a swap failure has occurred so that they can profit from the rewards when the swap succeeds later.

### Root Cause

`TokenRewards._swapForRewards` halves the token amount to be swapped for later retries.

```solidity
    function _swapForRewards(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountOut, uint256 _adminAmt) internal {
        if (_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0) {
            _adminAmt = (_adminAmt * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountOut = (_amountOut * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride;
        }
        uint256 _balBefore = IERC20(rewardsToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
        try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(
            PAIRED_LP_TOKEN,
            rewardsToken,
            REWARDS_POOL_FEE,
            _amountIn,
            _amountIn == REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN ? 0 : (_amountOut * (1000 - REWARDS_SWAP_SLIPPAGE)) / 1000,
            address(this)
        ) {
            _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride = 0;
            if (_adminAmt > 0) {
                _processAdminFee(_adminAmt);
            }
            _depositRewards(rewardsToken, IERC20(rewardsToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - _balBefore);
        } catch {
            _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride =
                _amountIn / 2 < REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN ? REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN : _amountIn / 2;
            IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
            emit RewardSwapError(_amountIn);
        }
    }
```

What this means is there will be instances where a user knows that there are pending rewards to be added. They can therefore exploit this to stake whenever there are swap failures to be retried therefore profiting unfairly.

They will profit from rewards that should have been allocated to users who had been staking when the swap failed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

`_swapForRewards` fails and `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` is stored to be retried later.

### External Pre-conditions

External DEX is unable to process a swap leading to a failure. 

### Attack Path

1. A swap for rewards fails after `depositFromPairedLpToken` has been called.
2. User notices the failure (`_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` will also contain a non zero value).
3. User stakes.
4. Swap for rewards finally succeeds and they earn a part of the rewards even though the deposit of rewards happened when they werent staking.

### Impact

Loss of rewards for existing stakers.
New staker unfairly profits from earlier staker rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Possibly track the non swapped rewards and exclude them from newer stakers.
