# `PodUnwrapLocker` will cause financial loss for users as debond fees are applied during lock creation

### Summary

The protocol's design intended to allow fee-free debonding via cooldown locking through `PodUnwrapLocker`, but incorrectly uses the fee-applying `WeightedIndex.debond` path. This results in:  
1. **Hidden Fee Deduction**: Debond fees are applied during lock creation, reducing stored amounts before cooldown  
2. **Normal Withdrawal Loss**: Users receive less value than deposited despite waiting full lock period  
3. **Compounded Early Penalty**: Early withdrawal penalties calculate on pre-reduced amounts, amplifying losses  
The root cause stems from missing a fee-exempt debond path for locker-initiated transactions, violating core protocol guarantees about cooldown withdrawals. 

### Root Cause

In function `PodUnwrapLocker.debondAndLock` ([`PodUnwrapLocker.sol#L76`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/PodUnwrapLocker.sol#L76)) the locker contract calls `WeightedIndex.debond` which applies debond fees ([`WeightedIndex.sol#L176-L178`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L176-L178)), contradicting the locker's design purpose of fee-free debonding: 

```solidity
		/**
		 * @title PodUnwrapLocker
@>	 * @notice Allows users to debond from pods fee free with a time-lock period before they can withdraw their tokens.
		 * The lock duration is determined by each pod's debondCooldown config setting. Users can withdraw early if they choose,
		 * however they will realize a debondFee + 10% fee on early withdraw.
		 */
		contract PodUnwrapLocker is Context, ReentrancyGuard {
				// ...
		
		    function debondAndLock(address _pod, uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant {
						// ...
		
		        // Get token addresses and balances before debonding
		        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
		            _tokens[i] = _podTokens[i].token;
		            _balancesBefore[i] = IERC20(_tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
		        }
@>	        _podContract.debond(_amount, new address[](0), new uint8[](0));
		
		        uint256[] memory _receivedAmounts = new uint256[](_tokens.length);
		        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
@>	            _receivedAmounts[i] = IERC20(_tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)) - _balancesBefore[i];
		        }
		
						// ...
						
		        locks[_lockId] = LockInfo({
		            user: _msgSender(),
		            pod: _pod,
		            tokens: _tokens,
@>	            amounts: _receivedAmounts,
		            unlockTime: block.timestamp + _podConfig.debondCooldown,
		            withdrawn: false
		        });
		        
		        // ...						
		    }
		}
```

```solidity
		contract WeightedIndex is Initializable, IInitializeSelector, DecentralizedIndex {
				// ...
		
		    function debond(uint256 _amount, address[] memory, uint8[] memory) external override lock noSwapOrFee {
		        uint256 _amountAfterFee = _isLastOut(_amount) || REWARDS_WHITELIST.isWhitelistedFromDebondFee(_msgSender())
		            ? _amount
@>	            : (_amount * (DEN - _fees.debond)) / DEN;
@>	        uint256 _percSharesX96 = (_amountAfterFee * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _totalSupply;

						// ...
						
		        for (uint256 _i; _i < _il; _i++) {
@>	            uint256 _debondAmount = (_totalAssets[indexTokens[_i].token] * _percSharesX96) / FixedPoint96.Q96;
		            if (_debondAmount > 0) {
		                _totalAssets[indexTokens[_i].token] -= _debondAmount;
@>	                IERC20(indexTokens[_i].token).safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _debondAmount);
		            }
		        }
						
						// ...
		    }
		    
		    // ...
	 }
```

This results in:
1. Locked amounts being reduced by debond fees before storage

2. Normal withdrawal receiving reduced amount due to charged debond fees (`PodUnwrapLocker.withdraw`):

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _lockId) external nonReentrant {
        _withdraw(_msgSender(), _lockId);
    }
    
    function _withdraw(address _user, uint256 _lockId) internal {
				// ...

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _lock.tokens.length; i++) {
            if (_lock.amounts[i] > 0) {
@>              IERC20(_lock.tokens[i]).safeTransfer(_user, _lock.amounts[i]);
            }
        }
				
				// ...
    }    
```

3. Early withdrawals applying penalty fees on already reduced amounts (`PodUnwrapLocker.earlyWithdraw`):

```solidity
    function earlyWithdraw(uint256 _lockId) external nonReentrant {
				// ...

        // Penalty = debond fee + 10%
@>      uint256 _penaltyBps = _debondFee + _debondFee / 10;
        uint256[] memory _penalizedAmounts = new uint256[](_lock.tokens.length);
        
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _lock.tokens.length; i++) {
            if (_lock.amounts[i] > 0) {
@>              uint256 _penaltyAmount = (_lock.amounts[i] * _penaltyBps) / 10000;
                _penaltyAmount = _penaltyAmount == 0 && _debondFee > 0 ? 1 : _penaltyAmount;
@>              _penalizedAmounts[i] = _lock.amounts[i] - _penaltyAmount;
                if (_penaltyAmount > 0) {
                    IERC20(_lock.tokens[i]).safeTransfer(_feeRecipient, _penaltyAmount);
                }
@>              IERC20(_lock.tokens[i]).safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _penalizedAmounts[i]);
            }
        }
				
				// ...
    }
```

The core issue stems from using the standard debond path that applies fees, rather than implementing a dedicated fee-exempt debond mechanism for locker-initiated transactions. This violates the architectural intent of providing a fee-free cooldown withdrawal option.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. PodUnwrapLocker uses standard debond mechanism that applies 5% debond fee (example value)
2. Locked token amounts are stored post-fee deduction
3. Early withdrawal penalty (5.5% in example, 5% + 5% / 10) calculated on reduced amounts

### External Pre-conditions

1. User initiates debond-lock with 1000 POD tokens (1:1 asset backing in example)
2. User expects full 1000 token value after lock period
3. Protocol advertises locker as "fee-free with cooldown"

### Attack Path

1. User calls `PodUnwrapLocker.debondAndLock(1000 POD)`
   - Internally calls `WeightedIndex.debond` where applying 5% debond fees
   - `PodUnwrapLocker` contract receives 950 underlying tokens (1:1 example rate, 5% fee applied)
   - 950 tokens stored in locker
2. Normal Withdraw Scenario:
   - User calls `PodUnwrapLocker.withdraw` after required lock period
   - User expects full withdrawal (1000 tokens)
   - Receives stored lock-amount 950 tokens (5% loss vs expected 1000 tokens)
3. Early Withdraw Scenario:
   - User calls `PodUnwrapLocker.earlyWithdraw`
	 - User expects withdrawal with penalty: `1000 - (1000 * 5.5%) = 945 tokens`
   - Penalty applied to stored lock amount: `950 * 5.5% = 52.25 tokens` 
   - User receives 897.75 tokens (5% total loss vs expected 945 tokens)

### Impact

1. **Direct Financial Loss**:
   - Normal withdrawal: 5% loss (50 tokens on 1000 POD)
   - Early withdrawal: 5% loss (50 tokens on 1000 POD)
2. **Protocol Functionality Failure**:
   - Core feature (fee-free cooldown) operates with hidden fees
   - Early withdrawal penalty exceeds documented rates

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Implement Fee-Exempt Debond Path**:
   - Create `debondNoFee` function in `WeightedIndex` contract
   - Restrict access to `PodUnwrapLocker` via modifier
   - Bypass fee calculation when called by locker

2. **Modify Locker Workflow**:
   - Replace `debond` call with `debondNoFee` in `PodUnwrapLocker.debondAndLock`
   - Store pre-fee token amounts in locker
