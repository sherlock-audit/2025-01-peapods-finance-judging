# Incorrect Handling of Intermediate Token Balance in Two-Hop Swaps

### Summary

The [_swapV2()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L368) function improperly relies on the contract’s balance (balanceOf()) to determine the intermediate token amount for the second swap. This can lead to incorrect swap amounts if the contract holds residual tokens from previous transactions. The contract does not explicitly track the first swap’s output, leading to potential miscalculations in the second swap.

### Root Cause

The function [_swap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L368) assumes that _intermediateBal (used in the second swap) is derived exclusively from the first swap.
However, instead of tracking the actual received amount from the first swap, it defaults to reading balanceOf() of the intermediate token.
If the contract already holds some of this token before the first swap executes (e.g., due to previous transactions, leftovers, airdrops, or user transfers), _intermediateBal becomes inaccurate, causing incorrect execution of the second swap.

```solidity
if (_twoHops) {
            uint256 _intermediateBal = _amountOut > 0 ? _amountOut : IERC20(_path[1]).balanceOf(address(this));
            if (maxSwap[_path[1]] > 0 && _intermediateBal > maxSwap[_path[1]]) {
                _intermediateBal = maxSwap[_path[1]];
            }
            IERC20(_path[1]).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _intermediateBal);
            _amountOut = DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_path[1], _path[2], _intermediateBal, _amountOutMin, address(this));
        }
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. First swap executes but does not track the actual received amount.
2. _intermediateBal is read directly from balanceOf() instead of verifying the first swap’s output.
3. If _amountOut = 0 from the first swap, it still proceeds using the potentially incorrect _intermediateBal.


### External Pre-conditions

The contract has a nonzero balance of _path[1] before execution, due to previous transactions, leftovers, airdrops, or user transfers.


### Attack Path

1. User/contract initiates a two-hop swap with _swapV2().
2. First swap executes, but _amountOut is not explicitly tracked.
3. Intermediate balance is determined via balanceOf(), which may include pre-existing tokens.
4. Second swap executes based on incorrect _intermediateBal, potentially leading to over-swapping (excessive tokens swapped, impacting pricing) and incorrect swap calculations


### Impact

1. The second swap may be executed with an incorrect input amount, leading to unexpected outputs.
2. Loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Track the first swap’s actual output explicitly.

```solidity
uint256 _preSwapBal = IERC20(_path[1]).balanceOf(address(this));
_amountOut = DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_path[0], _path[1], _amountIn, _twoHops ? 0 : _amountOutMin, address(this));
uint256 _received = IERC20(_path[1]).balanceOf(address(this)) - _preSwapBal;
require(_received > 0, "First swap failed");
```
