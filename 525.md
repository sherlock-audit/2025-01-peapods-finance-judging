# Price-Oracle manipulation

**Description:**  
The protocol relies on a spot price oracle (`podOracle.getPodPerBasePrice()`) for slippage calculations. Spot price oracles are vulnerable to manipulation via flash loans, which can lead to significant financial losses during swaps or liquidity additions.

**Impact:**  
- Attackers can manipulate the oracle price to exploit slippage mechanisms.
- Potential for large-scale financial losses due to inaccurate pricing.

**Recommendation:**  
Replace the spot price oracle with a decentralized price feed or a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracle. Ensure that the oracle implementation is resistant to flash loan attacks.

**Code Reference:**  
```solidity
uint256 _minPtknOut = (
    podOracle.getPodPerBasePrice() * _pairedSwapAmt * 10 ** IERC20Metadata(address(pod)).decimals() * 95
) / 10 ** IERC20Metadata(_pairedLpToken).decimals() / 10 ** 18 / 100;
```
