# Borrower creating dust borrow orders will increase bad debt

### Summary

The function `borrowAsset()` lacks of dust amount check, leading to liquidation rewards being lower than gas fees. As a result, liquidators may avoid liquidating these orders, causing the protocol to accumulate bad debt.

### Root Cause

In [FraxLendPairCore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L903-L928) there is missing dust amount check.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

gas fee more than dust amount or liquidate reward

### Attack Path
Due to the absence of a dust amount limit in borrowAsset, the liquidation reward value may be lower than the gas cost.

```solidity
    function borrowAsset(uint256 _borrowAmount, uint256 _collateralAmount, address _receiver) 
        external
        nonReentrant
        isSolvent(msg.sender)
        returns (uint256 _shares)
    {
        if (_receiver == address(0)) revert InvalidReceiver();

        // Accrue interest if necessary
        _addInterest();

        // Check if borrow will violate the borrow limit and revert if necessary
        if (borrowLimit < totalBorrow.amount + _borrowAmount) revert ExceedsBorrowLimit();

        // Update _exchangeRate and check if borrow is allowed based on deviation
        (bool _isBorrowAllowed,,) = _updateExchangeRate();
        if (!_isBorrowAllowed) revert ExceedsMaxOracleDeviation();

        // Only add collateral if necessary
        if (_collateralAmount > 0) {
            _addCollateral(msg.sender, _collateralAmount, msg.sender);
        }

        // Effects: Call internal borrow function
        _shares = _borrowAsset(_borrowAmount.toUint128(), _receiver);
    }
```

An attacker can call `borrowAsset()` with `_borrowAmount` set to a dust amount. Over time, the borrow order becomes eligible for liquidation, but since the liquidation reward is lower than the gas fee, liquidators have no incentive to act. Additionally, liquidation bots may deplete their native tokens due to gas fees, causing them to stop operating.

### Impact

1. The protocol will accumulate debt
2. The project's liquidation bot may run out of native tokens due to gas fees.

### PoC

1. The current `borrowAsset` and `addCollateral` functions do not enforce a dust amount check.  
2. This behavior can result in bad debt and cause either the protocol itself or other liquidation bots to go bankrupt, as the rewards are insufficient to cover the liquidator's gas costs.

### Mitigation

In function `borrowAsset()` add dust amount check
