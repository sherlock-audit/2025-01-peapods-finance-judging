# `earlyWithdraw` will charge a significantly lower fee

### Summary

Early debond fee is set to be ` debond fee` + 10% of amount

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/PodUnwrapLocker.sol#L125-L126
```solidity
        // Penalty = debond fee + 10%
        uint256 _penaltyBps = _debondFee + _debondFee / 10;
        uint256[] memory _penalizedAmounts = new uint256[](_lock.tokens.length);
```

However as we can see from the code snippet it's actually `_debondFee` + 10% of  `_debondFee`, or `_debondFee * 11 / 10`.

### Root Cause

debond fee is significantly less than prescribed in the comments, leading to a lower gain or the system and a lower punishment for the user

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/PodUnwrapLocker.sol#L125-L126
```solidity
        // Penalty = debond fee + 10%
        uint256 _penaltyBps = _debondFee + _debondFee / 10;
        uint256[] memory _penalizedAmounts = new uint256[](_lock.tokens.length);
```

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User withdraws early 100k
2. debond fee is 10 DAI
3. User pays 11 DAI, instead of 10 DAI + 10% of 100k and has his assets way earlier than normal

### Impact

Users pay a significantly lower fee for early withdraw.

### Mitigation

Make sure the 10% is taken form the amounts, not the debond value.
