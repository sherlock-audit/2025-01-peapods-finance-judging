# Lack of slippage in ERC4626 mint/deposit functions

### Summary

When a user wants to mint shares via depositing assets, he needs to be ensured that he is getting an expected number of shares, but due to a lack of slippage, if underlying assets come just before he gets the shares, the `cbr` is going to be bigger and he is going to get less shares due to it.

### Root Cause

Lack of a slippage mechanism in `LendingAssetVault::deposit()`, giving the possibility of a user receiving less shares.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Underlying assets come just before user calls `deposit()`

### Attack Path

1. Bob calls `LendingAssetVault::deposit()` with 1e18 expecting to get 1e18 shares
2. Just before his tx is processed, underlying asset is being deposited as rewards, causing the ratio to be skewed from 100:100 to 95:100
3. Bob receives 5% less shares than the 1e18 intended

### Impact

Users will receive less shares due to no slippage mechanism

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a slippage check so users get an expected amount of shares
