# Skipping interest accruals will result in a loss for users

### Summary

Skipping interest accruals will result in a loss for users

### Root Cause

Upon adding interest through `FraxlendPairCore::addInterest()`, we have this piece of code:
```solidity
if (_currentUtilizationRate != 0 && _rateChange < (_currentUtilizationRate * minURChangeForExternalAddInterest) / UTIL_PREC) {
            emit SkipAddingInterest(_rateChange);
        } else {
            (, _interestEarned, _feesAmount, _feesShare, _currentRateInfo) = _addInterest();
        }
```
It skips interest for gas optimization purposes as explained in a comment above as according to the comment, the loss would be negligible. However, this report will explain a scenario where the loss exceeds the medium severity loss threshold.

### Attack Path

1. Let's imagine a scenario where the protocol hasn't been interacted with for a day, the interest of `FraxlendPair` is 10% and the total assets deposited are 1_000_000e18 which is 1,000,000\$ (assuming a stablecoin), the share to asset ratio is 1:1, thus total supply is 1_000_000e18 as well ([Fraxlend](https://etherscan.io/address/0x78bb3aec3d855431bd9289fd98da13f9ebb7ef15) which we are forking from has ~10 million in just one of their vaults, having 1/10 of that is perfectly achievable)
2. With the above information, the pending interest is equal to `1_000_000e18 * 0.1 / 365 = 273972602739726027397` (rounding down which makes the scenario in favour of low severity, still we will reach losses for medium severity despite rounding down)
3. Let's imagine `LendingAssetVault` has 250_000e18 total assets at a 1:1 share to asset ratio and 150_000e18 of them are utilized
4. A user who has 100_000e18 shares in `LendingAssetVault` wants to withdraw
5. Upon doing that, we will skip interest accrual due to the reason explained in the root cause, this will happen if the utilization ratio hasn't changed enough, we will also skip the `_updateAssetMetadataFromVault()` call due to the same reason
6. The assets the user will receive are `100000e18 * 250000e18 / 250000e18 = 100000e18`, 100,000\$ as the share to asset ratio is 1:1
7. If the interest was accrued and the metadata was updated, the calculations would be the following:
- the new vault CBR will equal `1e18 * (1000000e18 + 273972602739726027397) / 1000000e18 = 1000273972602739726` (due to the pending interest)
- `_vaultAssetRatioChange` will equal `1e18 * 1000273972602739726 / 1e18 - 1e18 = 273972602739726`
- `_changedUtilizedState` will equal `150000e18 * 273972602739726 / 1e18 = 41095890410958900000`
- this causes the total assets to increase by 41095890410958900000, to a total of `250000e18 + 41095890410958900000 = 250041095890410958900000`
8. If the user withdrew with the accrued interest and the updated metadata (the actual legit state), he would have received `100000e18 * 250041095890410958900000 / 250000e18 = 100016438356164383560000` which equals ~100,016\$ which makes the 100,000\$ actually received in step 6 a loss of ~16$ and a percentage loss of ~0.016% - the losses needed for medium severity according to the [rules](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#v.-how-to-identify-a-medium-issue) are 10\$ and 0.01%

### Impact

Loss of funds. The opposite scenario is also possible where the user deposits and is immediately in profit, this results in losses for the other suppliers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Properly update the interest upon actions such as depositing and withdrawing
