# Accounting for debond fee would raise the slipage tolerance inside `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp`

### Summary

`_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` calculates the `swapOut` amount, however it also includes the debond fee to the pod price, even though that pod won't be debonded, but instead added as LP into UNI.

### Root Cause
`_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` calculates the `_minPtknOut`, which is the base to pod token price, discounted by 5% (i.e. 5% slippage margin)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L311
```solidity
    function _pairedLpTokenToPodLp(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _deadline) internal returns (uint256 _amountOut) {
        // ...

        if (address(podOracle) != address(0)) {
            // calculate the min out with 5% slippage

            // (podBasePrice * _pairedSwapAmt * 10^(podDecimals) / 10^(pairedLpDecimals) / 1e18) * 95%
            _minPtknOut = (
                podOracle.getPodPerBasePrice() * _pairedSwapAmt * 10 ** IERC20Metadata(address(pod)).decimals() * 95
            ) / 10 ** IERC20Metadata(_pairedLpToken).decimals() / 10 ** 18 / 100;
        }

```

However the issue is that we use the same exact flow that is used in liquidations in frax lend, meaning that we assign debond fee to the output data inside `_calculateBasePerPTkn`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L104-L106
```solidity
    function getPodPerBasePrice() external view override returns (uint256 _pricePTknPerBase18) {
        _pricePTknPerBase18 = 10 ** (18 * 2) / _calculateBasePerPTkn(0);
    }

    function _calculateBasePerPTkn(uint256 _price18) internal view returns (uint256 _basePerPTkn18) {
        // pull from UniV3 TWAP if passed as 0
        if (_price18 == 0) {
            bool _isBadData;
            (_isBadData, _price18) = _getDefaultPrice18();
            if (_isBadData) {
                return 0;
            }
        }

    
        _basePerPTkn18 = _accountForCBRInPrice(pod, underlyingTkn, _price18);
        _basePerPTkn18 = _accountForUnwrapFeeInPrice(pod, _basePerPTkn18);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Slippage is 5% allowed
2. Debond fee is 10%
3. `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` is triggered and it calculate the price of the pod to be 100 USD
4. However the bond fee is aplied, lowering it to 90 USD
5. Now `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` also adds it's 5% slippage tolerance, making the final price 85.5 USD


Now if that's a malicious user or a an MEV bot he would be able to exploit the 14.5% slippage and profit reasonably, which in tern would be bad for the system as it would decrease the yield `AutoCompoundingPodLp` provides
 
### Impact

Assigning those fees would cause a higher slippage tolerance, as another 10% reduction in price due to debond fees would cause the slippage to increase from 5% to ~15%. This will enable users or MEV bots to manipulate the price before the swap and extract value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider having another flow (i.e. an `if`) that will trigger only for `AutoCompoundingPodLp` and allow us to get the price without including the debond fee in it.
