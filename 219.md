# Incorrect flashMint cost when hasTransferTax option is enabled

### Summary

When the `hasTransferTax` option is enabled, the `flashMint` will cost more than expected due to the additional transfer tax for minting and burning.

### Root Cause

It is expected that [`flashMint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L424-L436) costs 0.1% of the minted amount. The `flashMint` process involves minting new tokens to the recipient, followed by burning those tokens and covering the associated flash mint fees, which are also burned. The internal [`_update`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L159-L182) function does not exclude the `flashMint` process from transaction taxes. As a result, when the `hasTransferTax` option is enabled, the transaction tax is applied multiple times throughout the `flashMint` process:

1. Transaction tax for minting: 0.01%
2. Transaction tax when repaying the minted tokens: 0.01%
3. Transaction tax for burning: 0.01%
4. Fee for `flashMint`: 0.1%
5. Additional transaction tax fee for burning the main fee

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `hasTransferTax` option is enabled.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User executes a `flashMint`.
2. More fees are taken than expected.

### Impact

This issue results in users paying more fees than expected during the `flashMint` process when the `hasTransferTax` option is enabled. The additional transaction taxes applied at multiple stages lead to a higher overall cost, which could significantly reduce the effectiveness of the flash mint for users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, ensure that the `flashMint` process is excluded from the transaction tax logic in the `_update` function.
