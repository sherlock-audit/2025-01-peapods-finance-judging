# Reward tokens could be locked in `VotingPool` contract

### Summary

Using `VotingPool`, users can stake tokens from the token list set by the owner to earn rewards.
The owner sets the stakeable token and also `IStakingConversionFactor`, which defines the `getConversionFactor` function related to the token.
Looking at the current protocol implementation, `ConversionFactorPTKN` and `ConversionFactorSPTKN` exist together with `VotingPool`.
This means that `PTKN` or `SPTKN` are possible as tokens designated by the owner.
When users stake using `SPTKN`, the `VotingPool` contract receives reward tokens while transferring `SPTKN`.
As a result, some reward tokens will be locked in `VotingPool` contract because of the lack of mechanism handling reward tokens..

### Root Cause

`ConversionFactorPTKN` and [`ConversionFactorSPTKN`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/voting/ConversionFactorSPTKN.sol#L29-L36) exist together with `VotingPool`. This means that `SPTKN` is possible as stakable token.

While [staking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/voting/VotingPool.sol#L40) and [unstaking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/voting/VotingPool.sol#L54), `SPTKN` is transferred from and to `VotingPool` contract. This means that some reward tokens are distributed to `VotingPool` contract.

But there is no mechanism of handling reward tokens.
