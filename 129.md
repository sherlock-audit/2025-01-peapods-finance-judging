# Use of `highExchangeRate` for Borrower Solvency Checks

### Summary and Impact

The protocol checks whether a borrower is solvent by referencing `highExchangeRate` for collateral valuation. Because this uses the more optimistic price, a user’s collateral balance can appear sufficient even when it isn’t. This flaw contrasts with how liquidation uses a lower price (i.e. `lowExchangeRate`), causing a mismatch: a position might remain unliquidated while actually undercollateralized. If left unaddressed, it undermines the system’s assurances that all outstanding loans remain safe. Collateral is mispriced in solvency checks, violating the protocol’s expectation that the core loan mechanics precisely track real or conservative valuations. Over time, users holding undercollateralized positions can quietly accumulate bad debt, making the protocol pay out more than the collateral is worth.

This behavior misaligns with the documentation’s goal of ensuring that every loan remains above a defined Loan‐to‐Value threshold. It also breaks the invariant that any attempt to borrow or remove collateral must keep positions solvent at a fair or conservative exchange rate.

### Vulnerability Details

A core snippet from `FraxlendPairCore.sol` is the `_isSolvent(...)` function:

When `_exchangeRate` is set to `highExchangeRate`, the code multiplies the borrower’s debt by an artificially low factor (if that factor is in favor of the borrower), making the loan look safer than it actually is. Meanwhile, the liquidation path uses `lowExchangeRate`, so the system believes the collateral is worth less when it comes time to seize it. This mismatch can hide insolvent positions from real-time checks, thus letting them slip by standard LTV thresholds.

In normal operation, a protocol reliant on strong invariants must ensure consistent pricing for solvency checks. Using a generous rate in `_isSolvent(...)` contradicts those invariants. It’s not only an edge case; it’s a hidden means of undercollateralization.

### Recommendations

Use a uniformly conservative exchange rate for all collateral valuation steps to align the protocol’s solvency checks with the liquidation process. Specifically, rely on the lower or a mid-range rate whenever `_isSolvent(...)` is called. By ensuring the same (or more conservative) price across borrowing, collateral withdrawals, and liquidations, the protocol prevents users from exploiting the difference and maintains the invariant that no position is actually undercollateralized if it passes a solvency check.

A straightforward fix would be to replace references to `highExchangeRate` with `lowExchangeRate` or a safe average. The system should not treat collateral as more valuable when deciding whether it remains above the LTV threshold.
