# `_tokenToPodLp` will lower the yield of `AutoCompoundingPodLp` during volatile markets

### Summary

`AutoCompoundingPodLp` is made to compound staked LP. Where pod shares are paired with another asset and staked into UNIv2, then this LP is staked into another wrapper and then sent to `AutoCompoundingPodLp` to be compounded. The whole idea is for these shares to accrue more value when markets are volatile as pods charge a fee on transfers and thus when the market moves fast the pods accumulate more value.

However under those volatile markets, instead of `AutoCompoundingPodLp` to be compounding the volatile and price changes it wold be reducing the yield.

### Root Cause

When swapping with `_tokenToPodLp` we first charge a fee on the paired token
```solidity
    function _tokenToPodLp(address _token, uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountLpOutMin, uint256 _deadline)
        internal
        returns (uint256 _lpAmtOut)
    {
        uint256 _pairedOut = _tokenToPairedLpToken(_token, _amountIn);

        if (_pairedOut > 0) {
            uint256 _pairedFee = (_pairedOut * protocolFee) / 1000;
            if (_pairedFee > 0) {
                _protocolFees += _pairedFee;
                _pairedOut -= _pairedFee;
            }
            _lpAmtOut = _pairedLpTokenToPodLp(_pairedOut, _deadline);
            require(_lpAmtOut >= _amountLpOutMin, "M");
        }
    }
```

Where before the fee and before we get the paired token we call `_tokenToPairedLpToken`. 

And after the fee we invoke `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` to swap the `_pairedLpToken` into `pod` tokens and then LP them.
```solidity
        if (address(podOracle) != address(0)) {
            // calculate the min out with 5% slippage

            // (podBasePrice * _pairedSwapAmt * 10^(podDecimals) / 10^(pairedLpDecimals) / 1e18) * 95%
            _minPtknOut = (
                podOracle.getPodPerBasePrice() * _pairedSwapAmt * 10 ** IERC20Metadata(address(pod)).decimals() * 95
            ) / 10 ** IERC20Metadata(_pairedLpToken).decimals() / 10 ** 18 / 100;
        }

        IERC20(_pairedLpToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _pairedSwapAmt);
        try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_pairedLpToken, address(pod), _pairedSwapAmt, _minPtknOut, address(this)) returns (
            uint256 _podAmountOut
        ) {
            _podAmountOut = pod.balanceOf(address(this));
            _pairedRemaining = IERC20(_pairedLpToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - _protocolFees;

            IERC20(pod).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(indexUtils), _podAmountOut);
            IERC20(_pairedLpToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(indexUtils), _pairedRemaining);

            try indexUtils.addLPAndStake(
                pod, _podAmountOut, _pairedLpToken, _pairedRemaining, _pairedRemaining, lpSlippage, _deadline
            ) returns (uint256 _lpTknOut) {
                _amountOut = _lpTknOut;
            } catch {
                IERC20(pod).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(indexUtils), _podAmountOut);
                IERC20(_pairedLpToken).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(indexUtils), _pairedRemaining);
                emit AddLpAndStakeError(address(pod), _amountIn);
            }
        } catch {
            IERC20(_pairedLpToken).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _pairedSwapAmt);
            emit AddLpAndStakeV2SwapError(_pairedLpToken, address(pod), _pairedRemaining);
        }
```

However we give only 5% slippage tolerance and if the markets are volatile with fast price changes, then the TX will most likely fail, which means that on the next call we would charge the same fee on the same amount that should have been distributed.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Fee is 20%
 
1. Users swap reward tokens into paired LP worth 200 USD, these tokens get charged 40 USD in paired token value
2.  `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` tries to swap into pod tokens and LP them, but fails as price moves fast and the slippage is above 5%
3. After a few hours the flow gets triggered again with another 100 USD swapped into paired LP
4. The total paired LP it gets charge again 20% -> 160 + 100 = 260 * 20% = 52 USD in paired LP tokens

The second charge was 100 * 20% = 20, 52 - 20 = 32 tokens more, due to the first batch not being able to be swapped into the pod token and LP-ed into the pool. Now if the TX reverts again the next batch would also include this one and also charge the 20% fee.


Moreover malicious users can manipulate this by purposefully manipulating the slippage with a flash loan to lower the yield. This would be extremely cheap on ARB, BASE or POLY. It won't benefit them, however it would lower the yield for all of the other users.

### Impact

The same fee is charged on the same swapped amount, which would significantly decrees yield, especially in times where it should be the highest.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Charge the fee only on the new swapped balances. Also consider reworking the whole flow as it uses multiple swaps in a for loop that are not needed. First swap all of the rewards into the paired token, then execute the rest in `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp`.
