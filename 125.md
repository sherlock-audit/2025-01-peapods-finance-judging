# Using `addLeverageFromTkn` is impossible when there is more than 1 token in a pod

### Summary

Using `addLeverageFromTkn` is impossible when there is more than 1 token in a pod

### Root Cause

Upon using `addLeverageFromTkn` to convert a token to a pod, we have this code:
```solidity
_tkn.approve(_pod, _tkn.balanceOf(address(this)) - _tknBalBefore);
IDecentralizedIndex(_pod).bond(address(_tkn), _tkn.balanceOf(address(this)) - _tknBalBefore, _amtPtknMintMin);
```
The issue is that bonding usually requires multiple tokens, not just one:
```solidity
for (uint256 _i; _i < _il; _i++) {
      ...
     _transferFromAndValidate(IERC20(indexTokens[_i].token), _user, _transferAmt);
      ...
}
```
The function incorrectly assumes that approving just 1 token of a pod will work, however if there are 2 or more tokens in a pod (the expected and most common scenario, 99.9% of cases will be like that), then the function will simply not work.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

No attack path needed, using the function will not work for 99.9% of pods

### Impact

Broken functionality, rendering a functionality completely useless

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Compute the amounts needed of each token in a pod and approve them
