# Lack of Slippage Protection in debond() Allows Potential Value Loss

### Summary

The [debond()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L175) function lacks slippage protection, meaning users can experience unexpected value loss due to price fluctuations, front-running, or manipulation of the share-to-asset ratio. Since the function does not enforce a minimum asset withdrawal amount, attackers or large users can extract more value at the expense of smaller participants.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L175

The function [debond()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L175) calculates the withdrawal amount (_debondAmount) based on the share-to-asset ratio at the time of execution, without any safeguards against unfavorable price changes.

There is no minAssetsOut parameter which allows users to set a lower bound on withdrawals. Furthermore, _totalSupply and _totalAssets can be manipulated by large debond transactions, altering the ratio unfairly.
The _processPreSwapFeesAndSwap() function executes post-debond but does not directly mitigate slippage risks.

Hence, as a result of lack of slippage protection, there is financial loss for users.

```solidity
function debond(uint256 _amount, address[] memory, uint8[] memory) external override lock noSwapOrFee {
        uint256 _amountAfterFee = _isLastOut(_amount) || REWARDS_WHITELIST.isWhitelistedFromDebondFee(_msgSender())
            ? _amount
            : (_amount * (DEN - _fees.debond)) / DEN;
        uint256 _percSharesX96 = (_amountAfterFee * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _totalSupply;
        super._transfer(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
        _totalSupply -= _amountAfterFee;
        _burn(address(this), _amountAfterFee);
        _processBurnFee(_amount - _amountAfterFee);
        uint256 _il = indexTokens.length;
        for (uint256 _i; _i < _il; _i++) {
            uint256 _debondAmount = (_totalAssets[indexTokens[_i].token] * _percSharesX96) / FixedPoint96.Q96;
            if (_debondAmount > 0) {
                _totalAssets[indexTokens[_i].token] -= _debondAmount;
                IERC20(indexTokens[_i].token).safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _debondAmount);
            }
        }
        // an arbitrage path of buy pTKN > debond > sell TKN does not trigger rewards
        // so let's trigger processing here at debond to keep things moving along
        _processPreSwapFeesAndSwap();
        emit Debond(_msgSender(), _amount);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker or large liquidity provider identifies an upcoming withdrawal (debond) transaction in the mempool.
2. They debond a large amount of pTKN, artificially changing the _totalSupply and _totalAssets ratio.
3. This worsens the exchange rate for other users who debond immediately afterward.
4. The attacker can rebond at a better rate, extracting value from the system.


### Impact

Users may receive fewer assets than expected due to price changes between transaction submission and execution.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement slippage protection through a minAssetsOut parameter.
