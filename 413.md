# Users will suffer losses due to incorrect oracle price validation

### Summary

The improper boundary check on Chainlink oracle price limits will cause an invalid price to be considered valid for Peapods users as they may use an oracle feed where `minAnswer` or `maxAnswer` are set, and the contract does not correctly reject boundary values.

### Root Cause

In `_isValidAnswer()` function, the contract checks whether `_answer` is strictly greater than `maxAnswer` or strictly less than `minAnswer`, but does not reject cases where `_answer` is exactly equal to these limits:
```solidity
function _isValidAnswer(address _feed, int256 _answer) internal view returns (bool _isValid) {
    _isValid = true;
    int192 _min = IOffchainAggregator(IEACAggregatorProxy(_feed).aggregator()).minAnswer();
    int192 _max = IOffchainAggregator(IEACAggregatorProxy(_feed).aggregator()).maxAnswer();

    if (_answer > _max || _answer < _min) {
        _isValid = false;
    }
}
```

[ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle._isValidAnswer:112](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle.sol#L112-L112)

Since Peapods is a permissionless protocol, users may configure a price feed where these limits exist. If the market price experiences a sudden shift beyond reasonable limits, an incorrect price could still be accepted, leading to losses.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A Peapods user must configure a price feed that has `minAnswer` and/or `maxAnswer` set.
2. The price returned by the oracle must be exactly equal to `minAnswer` or `maxAnswer`.
3. The contract does not reject these boundary values, leading to an incorrect price being considered valid.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A Chainlink price feed must have `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` values set.
2. A market event must occur causing the oracle price to hit exactly `minAnswer` or `maxAnswer`.

### Attack Path

1. A Peapods user configures a price feed that has `minAnswer` and/or `maxAnswer` set.
2. A significant market movement occurs, causing the price to hit exactly `minAnswer` or `maxAnswer`.
3. The `_isValidAnswer()` function incorrectly considers this price as valid.
4. Transactions relying on this price proceed under false assumptions, leading to incorrect calculations and potential losses.

### Impact

Peapods users suffer a potential loss as transactions relying on price feeds may be executed with invalid prices, leading to incorrect asset valuations.
