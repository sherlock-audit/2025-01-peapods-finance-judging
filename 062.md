# ERC20 Race Condition in `LendingAssetVault` and `Autocompoundingpodlp` Withdraw Functions

### Summary

Malicious users can steal more shares than approved by front-running allowance changes. Missing atomic allowance updates in `_withdraw` functions across both `LendingAssetVault.sol` and `Autocompoundingpodlp.sol` allow malicious users to steal additional vault shares by front-running allowance changes, potentially draining users' approved shares.

### Root Cause

In both `LendingAssetVault.sol:178` ([[LendingAssetVault.sol#L176-L187](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol?plain=1#L176-L187)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol?plain=1#L176-L187)) and `AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol:194` ([[AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L190-L201](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol?plain=1#L190-L201)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol?plain=1#L190-L201)), the `_withdraw` function utilizes `_spendAllowance`, which checks allowances after interest updates. However, this does not mitigate the classic ERC20 approval race condition.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Owner must approve spender for X shares.
2. Owner must attempt to change approval to Y shares.
3. Functions `withdraw()` or `redeem()` must be callable by spender.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Owner approves Spender for 100 shares.
2. Owner attempts to reduce approval to 50 shares.
3. Spender front-runs with `withdraw()` using original 100 share allowance.
4. Owner's transaction reduces "remaining" allowance to 50.
5. Spender can now withdraw additional 50 shares.
6. Total withdrawn: 150 shares vs intended 100.

### Impact

Victims can lose additional vault shares beyond intended approvals. Given that shares represent underlying assets plus accrued interest across multiple vaults, losses could be substantial.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Implement `increaseAllowance`/`decreaseAllowance` functions for atomic updates.
2. Replace direct approval changes with these safer functions.
