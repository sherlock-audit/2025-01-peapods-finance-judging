# AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol does not comply with EIP-4626.

### Summary

The conversion between assets and shares in view functions will not account the rewards process. As the result preview function will return the price without the added rewards accounted. Specifically the `previewMint` and `previewDeposit` functions do not meet the specification of EIP4626. This may lead to difficulties in third party integration.


### Root Cause

Before `mint` and `deposit` the `AutoCompoundingPodLp` correctly process rewards. However, the preview of these functions fail to account these rewards upon calculating the needed or returning assets.

According to [EIP4626 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626):

> previewMint
> MUST return as close to and no fewer than the exact amount of assets that would be deposited in a mint call in the same transaction. I.e. mint should return the same or fewer assets as previewMint if called in the same transaction.

In the `mint` function, the `_processRewardsToPodLp` was called before `_convertToAssets`. After the `_processRewardsToPodLp`, the `_totalAsset` might increase, and therefore `_cbr` and `_convertToAssets` might subsequently increase. As the result, the `mint` might return more assets than `previewMint`.

> previewDeposit
> MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be minted in a deposit call in the same transaction. I.e. deposit should return the same or more shares as previewDeposit if called in the same transaction.

In the `deposit` function, the `_processRewardsToPodLp` was called before `_convertToShares`. After the `_processRewardsToPodLp` , the `_totalAsset` and `_cbr` might increase, so the `_convertToShares` might then decrease. As the result, the `deposit` might return less assets than `previewDeposit`.




### Internal Pre-conditions

Rewards is added without `AutoCompoundingPodLp.processAllRewardsTokensToPodLp`


### External Pre-conditions

Third party integration expecting the preview functions meeting the EIP4626 specification.


### Attack Path

Anyone can send rewards to the `AutoCompouningPodLp` to force the `previewMint` and `previewDeposit` functions to deviate from the EIP-4626 specification.


### Impact

Third party integration may lead to malfunction of their protocol.

For example, the `previewMint` function could be used to determine how much of asset should be approved. But since the `AutoCompouningPodLp.mint` pulls more than `previewMint` specifies, whoever relies on the `previewMint` for approval will fail to mint.

Likewise, if the third party relies on the `previewDeposit` to check whether enough shares are minted, they might as well fail that check.



### PoC

The below example shows the possible usage of `previewMint` and `previewDeposit` for approval and checks.

```solidity
    function testProcessAllRewardsTokensToPodLp_POC() public {
        // Mock the necessary functions and set up the test scenario
        address[] memory rewardTokens = new address[](2);
        rewardTokens[0] = address(rewardToken1);
        rewardTokens[1] = address(rewardToken2);

        mockTokenRewards.setProcessedRewardTokens(rewardTokens);

        uint256 lpAmountOut = 50 * 1e18;
        mockDexAdapter.setSwapV3SingleReturn(lpAmountOut);
        deal(autoCompoundingPodLp.pod().PAIRED_LP_TOKEN(), address(autoCompoundingPodLp), lpAmountOut);
        mockIndexUtils.setAddLPAndStakeReturn(lpAmountOut);

        // Set initial totalAssets
        uint256 initialTotalAssets = 1000 * 1e18;
        deal(address(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()), address(this), initialTotalAssets);
        IERC20(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()).approve(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), initialTotalAssets);
        autoCompoundingPodLp.deposit(initialTotalAssets, address(this));

        uint256 rewardAmount = 100 * 1e18;
        rewardToken1.mint(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), rewardAmount);
        rewardToken2.mint(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), rewardAmount);

        // user
        uint256 userAsset = 100 * 1e18;
        deal(address(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()), user, userAsset);
        uint256 sharesToMint = 1e18;
        uint prevMint = autoCompoundingPodLp.previewMint(sharesToMint);

        vm.startPrank(user);
        IERC20(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()).approve(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), prevMint);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20Errors.ERC20InsufficientAllowance.selector, address(autoCompoundingPodLp), prevMint, 1.1e18));
        autoCompoundingPodLp.mint(sharesToMint, user);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Another rewards
        rewardToken1.mint(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), rewardAmount);
        rewardToken2.mint(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), rewardAmount);

        deal(address(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()), address(this), 1e18);
        uint sharesExpected = autoCompoundingPodLp.previewDeposit(1e18);
        IERC20(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()).approve(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), 1e18);
        uint sharesBefore = IERC20(autoCompoundingPodLp).balanceOf(address(this));
        autoCompoundingPodLp.deposit(1e18, address(this));
        uint sharesAfter = IERC20(autoCompoundingPodLp).balanceOf(address(this));
        // the actual shares from deposit should bigger than expected
        // but this is violated
        require(sharesAfter - sharesBefore < sharesExpected);
    }
```



### Mitigation

Consider using preview processRewards function like `LendingAssetVault` does.
