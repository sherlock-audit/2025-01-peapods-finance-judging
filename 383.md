# LendingAssetVault is not comply with ERC4626 when asset is a pod

### Root Cause

> previewDeposit MUST be inclusive of deposit fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of deposit fees.

> previewMint MUST be inclusive of deposit fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of deposit fees

> previewWithdraw MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.

>  previewRedeem MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.

Index tokens can have another index token as a pairLpToken and also index token'owner can attach a Frax lending pair to his/her index token through `LeverageFactory::addLvfSupportForPod` and then a new Frax lending pair will be deployed with a index token as borrow asset

```solidity
    function addLvfSupportForPod(
        address _pod,
        address _dexAdapter,
        address _indexUtils,
        bytes memory _aspTknOracleRequiredImmutables,
        bytes memory _aspTknOracleOptionalImmutables,
        bytes memory _fraxlendPairConfigData
    ) external onlyOwner returns (address _aspTkn, address _aspTknOracle, address _fraxlendPair) {
        @>>> address _borrowTkn = IDecentralizedIndex(_pod).PAIRED_LP_TOKEN();
        ...
        @>>> _fraxlendPair = _createFraxlendPair(_borrowTkn, _aspTkn, _aspTknOracle, _fraxlendPairConfigData);

        // this effectively is what "turns on" LVF for the pair
        ILeverageManagerAccessControl(leverageManager).setLendingPair(_pod, _fraxlendPair);

        emit AddLvfSupportForPod(_pod, _aspTkn, _aspTknOracle, _fraxlendPair);
    }
```

and this Frax lending pair can be added to LendingAssetVault as a whitelisted pair to deposit liquidity by LendingAssetVault'owner and there is a tip here and that is index tokens can have tranferTax

```solidity

    function _update(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal override {

        @>>    } else if (!_buy && !_sell && _config.hasTransferTax) {
                _fee = _amount / 10000; // 0.01%
                _fee = _fee == 0 && _amount > 0 ? 1 : _fee;
                super._update(_from, address(this), _fee);
            }
        }
        _processBurnFee(_fee);
        super._update(_from, _to, _amount - _fee);
    }
```

### Internal Condition

hasTransferTax is true

### PoC

> previewRedeem MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of assets that would be withdrawn in a redeem call in the same transaction. I.e. redeem should return the same or more assets as previewRedeem if called in the same transaction.

> previewWithdraw MUST return as close to and no fewer than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be burned in a withdraw call in the same transaction. I.e. withdraw should return the same or fewer shares as previewWithdraw if called in the same transaction.

As we know because of tax received value is less than value which user gets through previewRedeem and previewWithdraw and this causes LendingAssetvault don't comply with ERC4626

### Impact

LendingAssetVault isn't comply with ERC4626

### Mitigation

Consider to tax in preview functions
