# No slippage upon withdrawing from `LendingAssetVault` will result in a loss for the withdrawer

### Summary

No slippage upon withdrawing from `LendingAssetVault` will result in a loss for the withdrawer

### Root Cause

Upon withdrawing from `LendingAssetVault`, we have this code:
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _assets, address _receiver, address _owner) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(address(0));
        _shares = convertToShares(_assets);
        _withdraw(_shares, _assets, _owner, _msgSender(), _receiver);
    }
```
As seen, there is no slippage which will cause a user to receive less than expected in a certain case.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User wants to withdraw his 100 shares and expects to receive 100 assets in return
2. While his transaction is in the mempool, there is a bad debt liquidation in the underlying pair (`FraxlendPair`)
3. Instead of receiving 100 assets, he only receives 50 as the share value went down due to step 2

### Impact

Users receive less than expected

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow users to provide the minimum amount of assets they are willing to receive
