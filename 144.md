# Tokens can be locked in tokenBridge

### Summary

When `bridgeTokens`, source chain locks or burns user tokens and send message via `CCIP` and target chain mint or transfer tokens.
But if `_ccipReceive` fails,  bridging fails in target chain but it doesn't revert in source chain.
It means user can lose tokens.
`require(tokenRouter.globalEnabled(), "GLDISABLED");` and `require(_bridgeConf.enabled, "BRDISABLED");` check `enabled` but even though admin is going to disable at the same time in source chain and target chain, it can't be set at same time because different network.
And also `TokenBridge` contract doesn't have `pause` mechanism. So when changing configuration, bridging tokens can't be paused.

Admin can't set flags in multi chains at same time and also can't prevent bridging tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

In source chain and target chain, configuration mismatch must happen.


### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. source chain sets true for bridging tokens.
 `require(tokenRouter.globalEnabled(), "GLDISABLED");`, `require(_bridgeConf.enabled, "BRDISABLED");` passed
2. target chain sets false for bridging tokens.
  `require(tokenRouter.globalEnabled(), "GLDISABLED");`, `require(_bridgeConf.enabled, "BRDISABLED");` reverts

Source Chain Bridge contract locked or burned user tokens but user can't claim his lost tokens.

### Impact

User tokens can lost his tokens when bridging.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement `pause` mechanism and admin must pause before changing configuration for bridging.
