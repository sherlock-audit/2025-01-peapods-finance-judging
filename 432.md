# Predictable CREATE2 Salt Leads to Address Collision and Stuck Funds

The contract computes deployment addresses using `CREATE2` with a predictable [_getFullSalt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLpFactory.sol#L76-L78) function that only incorporates `address(this)` and a user-provided `_salt`, making it vulnerable to precomputed address collisions. An attacker can front-run a legitimate contract deployment by deploying a minimal contract at the precomputed address before the factory executes `create()`. Since `CREATE2` does not overwrite existing contracts, the factory call fails, but if `_depositMin()` was executed before the failure, user funds remain stuck in the factory. Below is the flawed `_getFullSalt()` implementation:  
```solidity
function _getFullSalt(uint96 _salt) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return uint256(uint160(address(this))) + _salt;
}
```
And the `_deploy()` function fails to validate contract creation:  
```solidity
function _deploy(bytes memory _bytecode, uint256 _finalSalt) internal returns (address _addr) {
    assembly {
        _addr := create2(callvalue(), add(_bytecode, 0x20), mload(_bytecode), _finalSalt)
        if iszero(_addr) { revert(0, 0) } // @audit-info Missing extcodesize check
    }
}
```
This results in a scenario where `_depositMin()` transfers funds, but the expected `AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract is never deployed, permanently locking user assets inside the factory.  

## Impact
Users can permanently lose funds if `_depositMin()` is called before a failed deployment due to an attacker preoccupying the expected contract address.  

## Mitigation
Modify `_getFullSalt()` to include `msg.sender` to ensure salt uniqueness and verify contract creation using `extcodesize()` before transferring funds.
