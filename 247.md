# Users can avoid paying close fee by setting `_podSwapAmtOutMin` high.

### Summary

Users pay a close fee based on the amount of Pod token received when removing leverage.
Users can reduce the amount of Pod token received from removing leverage, by setting `_podSwapAmtOutMin` high. `_podSwapAmtOutMin` is used as the amount of `pairedLpToken` that the user wants to receive by swapping pod tokens.
This means that the user can avoid the close fee..

### Root Cause

`_podSwapAmtOutMin` which is the parameter of [`removeLeverage`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L154) function, is used as the amount of `pairedLpToken` to receive as a result of the swap in [`_swapPodForBorrowToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L466) function.

The current code implementation is incorrect in handling the remaining `pairedLpToken` when `_podSwapAmtOutMin > _targetNeededAmt`, but `_podSwapAmtOutMin` exactly represents the amount of `pairedLpToken` that the user wants to receive by swapping the pod token. (The issue of not tracking accurate amount of remaining `pairedLpToken` will definitely be fixed.)

[Close fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L227) is calculated from the amount of pod tokens that the user receives after removing leverage and does not care about `pairedLpToken`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No response

### External Pre-conditions

No response

### Attack Path

1. User calls `removeLeverage` function and sets `_podSwapAmtOutMin` as 100.
2. After `_unstakeAndRemoveLP`, the amount of pod token that user will receive is 100.
3. `_repayAmount - _pairedAmtReceived` is 10 so only 10 of pod token is needed for 10 of `pairedLpToken`. (Assume that the price of pod token and the  pairedLpToken is the same)
4. 100 of pod token is swapped to `pairedLpToken` becasue `_podSwapAmtOutMin` is 100.
5. The amount of remaining pod token is 0 and no close fee.
6.  If `_podSwapAmtOutMin` is set to 0, so that only the required amount of pod tokens are swapped, the close fee is calculated with 90 of pod token.

### Impact

Users can avoid paying close fee when removing leverage.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Calculate the close fee for the `pairedLpToken` that is received after the leverage is removed.
Or check the use of the `_podSwapAmtOutMin` variable in `_swapPodForBorrowToken` function.
