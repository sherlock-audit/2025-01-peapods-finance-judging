# Hardcoded Contract Addresses in the Code Base Are Not Available on Some Chains

## Summary

The code base hardcoded several contract addresses, but some of them are not avaialable in some of the chains mentioned in the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/README.md#q-on-what-chains-are-the-smart-contracts-going-to-be-deployed).

For example, the contract `Zapper` has several issues with tokens and routers that are not available across all chains. These issues could lead to mismatches or errors when interacting with the contract on unsupported networks.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are no checks or logic to handle differences across networks, which means the contract might malfunction when deployed on chains where certain tokens or liquidity pools or contarcts do not exist.

1. **Unsupported Tokens and Routers in Zapper Contract **: 
   - The following [addresses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Zapper.sol#L23C5-L26C77) are hardcoded for tokens and routers that are not available on some chains like Arbitrum, Base, Mode, and Berachain:
     - `STYETH` (StyEth) [Not available in arbitrum, base, mode, berachain]
     - `YETH` (Yeth) [Not available in arbitrum, base, mode, berachain]
     - `WETH_YETH_POOL` [Not available in arbitrum, base, mode, berachain]
     - `V3_ROUTER` [Not available in base, mode, berachain]
     - `OHM` (Olympus) [Not available in arbitrum, base, mode, berachain]
   - Since the contract assumes these addresses are valid on all chains, this can lead to failures when deployed on chains where they are not supported.

2. **Aerodrome CLFactory is not available in Ethereum, Arbitrum, Mode and Berachain**: 
   https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/AerodromeDexAdapter.sol#L20

3. **Camelot UniswapV2Router02 is not available in Ethereum, Base, Mode and Berachain**: 
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L18

## Impact

This issue could cause a contract to fail when interacting with tokens, pools, or routers on unsupported networks. This would result in transaction reverts or incorrect behavior, especially for users who are interacting with the contract on Arbitrum, Base, Mode, and Berachain.

## Tool used
Manual Review 

## Recommendation
**Implement Chain-Specific Logic**:	Check the chain the contract is deployed on and adjust addresses accordingly, either by defining them in a chain-specific mapping or by using a contract registry for tokens and routers.
