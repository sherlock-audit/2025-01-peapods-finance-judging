# An incorrect balance adjustment will lock funds for users in AutoCompoundingPodLp._swapV2()

### Summary

The incorrect adjustment of `_intermediateBal `in `AutoCompoundingPodLp._swapV2()` will cause funds to be locked in the contract for users as the function restricts the second swap amount without handling excess funds properly.

### Root Cause

In `AutoCompoundingPodLp._swapV2()`, when `_path[1]` has a `maxSwap` limit, `_intermediateBal `is reduced to `maxSwap[_path[1]]`.
This adjustment does not account for the leftover balance, leading to unspent tokens remaining in the contract.
So there will be these excess tokens in `_path[1]` on this contract.

So when `_path[0]` doesn't have any `maxSwap` (`maxSwap[_path[0]] == 0`), it will swap all `amountIn` to `_path[1]`.
But, at line 382, as we have `maxSwap` at `_path[1]`, the `_intermediateBal ` will be reduced at line 383, and the funds are locked in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `_swapV2` is called with _path.length == 3 (i.e., a two-hop swap).
2. `maxSwap[_path[0]] == 0` (no limit on the first token).
3. `maxSwap[_path[1]] > 0` (a limit exists on the second token).
4. The first swap results in `_intermediateBal > maxSwap[_path[1]]`.

### External Pre-conditions

The DEX liquidity is sufficient for both swaps to execute normally.
The price impact on `_path[1]` does not change significantly between swaps.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `_swapV2` with a valid `_path` and `_amountIn`.
2. The first swap is executed successfully, producing `_intermediateBal`.
3. `_intermediateBal` is higher than `maxSwap[_path[1]]`, so the function caps it.
4. The second swap executes only with the capped amount.
5. The remaining balance in `_path[1]` is left in the contract with no way to withdraw it.

### Impact

**Users suffer a loss of funds**, as tokens in `_path[1]` remain in the contract and cannot be retrieved.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Estimate the First Swapâ€™s Output Before Executing It
We should: **Pre-calculate** `_amountOut` using a price estimation function before swapping.
Adjust `_amountIn` accordingly if `_amountOut` will exceed `maxSwap[_path[1]]`.

```solidity

// Adjust first swap amount if maxSwap is set for _path[0]
if (maxSwap[_path[0]] > 0 && _amountIn > maxSwap[_path[0]]) {
    _amountOutMin = (_amountOutMin * maxSwap[_path[0]]) / _amountIn;
    _amountIn = maxSwap[_path[0]];
}

// Pre-check expected output before first swap
uint256 expectedOut = DEX_ADAPTER.getSwapOutput(_path[0], _path[1], _amountIn);

// Adjust amountIn if expected output exceeds maxSwap[_path[1]]
if (_twoHops && maxSwap[_path[1]] > 0 && expectedOut > maxSwap[_path[1]]) {
    uint256 adjustedAmountIn = (_amountIn * maxSwap[_path[1]]) / expectedOut;
    _amountIn = adjustedAmountIn;
    _amountOutMin = (_amountOutMin * adjustedAmountIn) / _amountIn;
}

```
