# Catch mechanism will revert for tokens such as BNB

### Summary

Catch mechanism will revert for tokens such as BNB

### Root Cause

Upon swapping tokens in `TokenRewards` (similar thing is also in other places in code), we have the following code:
```solidity
try
            DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(...)
        {
            ...
        } catch {
            ...
            IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
            ...
        }
```
The `safeDecreaseAllowance()` call will fail if the `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is BNB as upon approving `BNB` to 0, this causes a revert:
```solidity
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)
        returns (bool success) {
		if (_value <= 0) throw; 
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        return true;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The swap fails and it is supposed to be caught in the `catch` block (can fail due to let's say, the slippage provided and can be abused by an attacker by conducting a swap before the call)
2. Upon decreasing the allowance to 0, this calls `approve()` with 0 on the BNB token
3. This results in a revert

### Impact

DoS of functionalities as the catch mechanism doesn't work, this can be abused by malicious users by making the swap fail due to  the provided slippage and the catch mechanism will then fail.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not approve tokens such as BNB to 0
