# StaticOracle has been hardcoded here but Mode and Berachain doesn't have this contract

### Root Cause

[Static Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb210ce856631eeeb767efa666ec7c1c57738d438) has been used in `DualOracleChainlinkUniV3::getPrices`
and as we know the code will be deployed in different networks like Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Base, Mode, Berachain based on Readme but the oracle' address
has been hardcoded and Mode Network doesn't have this contract and this causes this contract be unuseable in Mode network

```solidity

    function getPrices() external view returns (bool _isBadData, uint256 _priceLow, uint256 _priceHigh) {
        address[] memory _pools = new address[](1);
        _pools[0] = UNI_V3_PAIR_ADDRESS;
    @>>>    uint256 _price1 = IStaticOracle(0xB210CE856631EeEB767eFa666EC7C1C57738d438).quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
            ORACLE_PRECISION, BASE_TOKEN, QUOTE_TOKEN, _pools, TWAP_DURATION
        );
        uint256 _price2;
        (_isBadData, _price2) = _getChainlinkPrice();

        // If bad data return price1 for both, else set high to higher price and low to lower price
        _priceLow = _isBadData || _price1 < _price2 ? _price1 : _price2;
        _priceHigh = _isBadData || _price1 > _price2 ? _price1 : _price2;
    }
```

### Internal Condition

chain = Mode

### Mitigation

consider to store the Oracle'address in a storage and allow that be updatable
