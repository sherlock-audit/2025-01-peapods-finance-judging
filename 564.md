# Missing Slippage Protection in `WeightedIndex.debond` Enables Flash Loan-Powered Sandwich Attacks

### Summary

The missing minimum output validation in `WeightedIndex.debond` will cause partial loss of funds for users withdrawing from the index as attackers can manipulate withdrawal ratios through flash loan-powered sandwich attacks. By front-running a user's `WeightedIndex.debond` transaction with a large `WeightedIndex.bond` operation funded by flash loans, attackers artificially inflate the index's total supply, reducing the victim's share percentage and withdrawn token amounts. This allows attackers to profit from the manipulated asset ratios while victims receive significantly less value than market rates.

### Root Cause

The `WeightedIndex.debond` function in [`WeightedIndex.sol#L185-L191`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L185-L191) lacks critical slippage protection mechanisms, enabling sandwich attacks through:

```solidity
    function debond(uint256 _amount, address[] memory, uint8[] memory) external override lock noSwapOrFee {
        uint256 _amountAfterFee = _isLastOut(_amount) || REWARDS_WHITELIST.isWhitelistedFromDebondFee(_msgSender())
            ? _amount
            : (_amount * (DEN - _fees.debond)) / DEN;
@>      uint256 _percSharesX96 = (_amountAfterFee * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _totalSupply;
				
				// ...
				
        for (uint256 _i; _i < _il; _i++) {
@>          uint256 _debondAmount = (_totalAssets[indexTokens[_i].token] * _percSharesX96) / FixedPoint96.Q96;
            if (_debondAmount > 0) {
                _totalAssets[indexTokens[_i].token] -= _debondAmount;
@>              IERC20(indexTokens[_i].token).safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _debondAmount);
            }
        }
				
				// ...
    }
```

1. **Manipulable Share Calculation**:
   - The `_percSharesX96` ratio (L185) uses real-time `_totalSupply` that attackers can inflate via front-run `WeightedIndex.bond` calls
   - Withdrawal amounts are calculated based on current `_totalAssets` balances that can be altered through flash loan attacks

2. **Absence of Minimum Output Checks**:
   - No parameters allow users to specify minimum acceptable amounts for each withdrawn token
   - Direct transfers at L191 execute regardless of actual asset values relative to market prices

3. **Attack Vector**:
   - Attacker front-runs user's `debond` with large `bond` to manipulate `_totalSupply` and asset ratios
   - User's calculated `_percSharesX96` yields fewer assets than expected
   - Attacker reverses position post-user-transaction through `debond`, profiting from manipulated ratios

The core vulnerability lies in the withdrawal process relying entirely on manipulable contract state without user-defined safety thresholds for asset outputs.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `debond` function calculates withdrawals using real-time `_totalSupply` and `_totalAssets`
2. No minimum amount validation exists for individual token withdrawals
3. `bond` function allows arbitrary supply inflation without cooldown/limits

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker has access to flash loan facilities
2. Index contains sufficient liquidity in underlying tokens (e.g., $1M TVL)
3. At least 2 tokens exist in the index with liquid markets

### Attack Path

1. Victim initiates debond of 100,000 index tokens (worth $100k at fair value)
2. Attacker front-runs transaction with:
   a. $500k flash loan
   b. `bond` call injecting 500,000 index tokens via manipulated pricing
3. Victim's transaction executes:
   - `_totalSupply` inflated from 1M to 1.5M tokens
   - `_percSharesX96` becomes 6.66% instead of 10%
   - Receives $66.6k worth of assets instead of $100k
4. Attacker back-runs with `debond` of 500k tokens:
   - Withdraws $333k using same manipulated ratios
   - Repays flash loan with $500k principal
5. Net profit: $333k (withdrawn) - $500k (loan) + $500k (repayment) + $33.4k (victim loss) = $33.4k profit

### Impact

Victim suffers 33.4% immediate financial loss ($100k ➔ $66.6k) due to artificial supply inflation. Attack scales linearly with victim position size - a $1M debond under same conditions would yield $666k loss. Losses become permanent when attacker arbitrages manipulated assets against real markets.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement mandatory slippage protection in the `debond` function through:

1. **Minimum Output Parameters**:
   - Add a `uint256[] calldata minAmounts` parameter for per-token minimums
   - Require withdrawn amounts ≥ specified minimums

2. **Validation Layer**:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < indexTokens.length; ++i) {
		uint256 debondAmount = ...; // Existing calculation
		require(debondAmount >= minAmounts[i], "Below minimum");
}
```

3. **Parameter Consistency Checks**:

```solidity
		require(minAmounts.length == indexTokens.length, "Invalid input length");
```

4. **Front-running Resistance**:
   - Use deadline parameters to invalidate stale transactions
   - Implement TWAP-based checks for critical ratios

This matches the existing `bond` function's `_amountMintMin` pattern, creating symmetric protection for deposit/withdrawal operations.
