# PodUnwrapLocker 10% extra penalty is not enforced if the original debond fee is not a multiple of 10

### Summary

when penaltyBps is to be calculated in the unwrap locker early withdraw , it directly divides the debondFee / 10 to calculate the penaltyBps

```solidity
        uint256 _penaltyBps = _debondFee + _debondFee / 10;
        uint256[] memory _penalizedAmounts = new uint256[](_lock.tokens.length);


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _lock.tokens.length; i++) {
            if (_lock.amounts[i] > 0) {
                uint256 _penaltyAmount = (_lock.amounts[i] * _penaltyBps) / 10000;
                _penaltyAmount = _penaltyAmount == 0 && _debondFee > 0 ? 1 : _penaltyAmount;
                _penalizedAmounts[i] = _lock.amounts[i] - _penaltyAmount;
                if (_penaltyAmount > 0) {
                    IERC20(_lock.tokens[i]).safeTransfer(_feeRecipient, _penaltyAmount);
                }
                IERC20(_lock.tokens[i]).safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _penalizedAmounts[i]);
            }
        }
```
the issue here is solidity does not support floating point numbers, always rounding down the issues of computations that result in floating point numbers 
this means that if the original debond fee is not a multiple of 10 or even worse is less then 10, the result will round down 

### Root Cause

division in solidity always rounds down 

### Internal Pre-conditions

Index contract whitelisting a podUnwrapLocker from debond fees 
pod debond fee is not a multiple of 10 

### External Pre-conditions

users debond via podUnwrapLocker 

### Attack Path

1. user debond via PodUnwrapLocker 
2. user doesnt wants to wait anymore and decides to withdraw early 
3. when penaltyBps is calculated, it rounds down 
4. user pays less in penalty as a result

### Impact

users will be able to early debond paying less or no extra penalty at all 
the value lost due to truncation could be great depending on the amount being withdrawn 
eg considering an original debond fee of 965bps ie 9.65 percent , 0.05 % will be truncated 
assuming assets withdrawn = 100_000 usdc, that will result in a 50usdc loss for the protocol 

### PoC

take the following example with a debondFee of 0.5% ie 5bps 
when _penaltyBps is calculated 
_penaltyBps= 5 + 5 / 10  = 5 + 0 = 5
the final penalty percent paid is still 5bps 

same would happen for a be

### Mitigation

scale debond fee when performing computation 
using the above example 
debondFee = debondFee * 1e13
_penaltyBps= debondFee + debondFee / 10 
penaltyAmount = (_lock.amounts[i] * _penaltyBps) /
                    1e18;
