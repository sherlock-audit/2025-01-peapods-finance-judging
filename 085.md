# `_swapForRewards` can be MEVed

### Summary

Users and MEV bots can extract value from the system as `_swapForRewards` will sometimes perform a faulty swap.

### Root Cause

The bellow try would execute a swap with 0 `amountOut` when `amountIn == REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN`

```solidity
        try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(
            PAIRED_LP_TOKEN,
            rewardsToken,
            REWARDS_POOL_FEE,
            _amountIn,
            //@finding M users can MEV this with FR and backrun to manipulate the prices
            _amountIn == REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN 
                ? 0 
                : (_amountOut * (1000 - REWARDS_SWAP_SLIPPAGE)) / 1000,
            address(this)
        ) {
```

### Attack Path

1. `depositFromPairedLpToken` is triggered, however due to slippage or any other reason the swap fails
2. We have entered the `catch` and the second case in the short if, which have set `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` to `REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN`
```solidity
            _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride = _amountIn / 2 < REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN 
                ? REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN 
                : _amountIn / 2;
```
3. The next user or MEV bot who calls `depositFromPairedLpToken` would trigger this `if`, which would set the new `_amountIn` to `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride`, which is equal to `REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN`
```solidity
        if (_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0) {
            _adminAmt = (_adminAmt * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountOut = (_amountOut * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride;
        }
```
4. We would execute the swap, with 0 out as the bellow if will set it to 0, when `_amountIn == REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN `

```solidity
        try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(
            PAIRED_LP_TOKEN,
            rewardsToken,
            REWARDS_POOL_FEE,
            _amountIn,
            _amountIn == REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN 
                ? 0 
                : (_amountOut * (1000 - REWARDS_SWAP_SLIPPAGE)) / 1000,
            address(this)
        ) {
```

Meaning that a user would just need to:
1. swap and change the price
2. call `depositFromPairedLpToken`
3. Swap back to the original price

Thus every time we enter the catch and set `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` to `REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN` this vulnerability becomes exploitable.

Note that this may be more profitable on expensive chains like ETH, as there the `REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN` will be a bigger value, as each swap would cost somewhere between 5 and 20 USD in eth, so `REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN` of 100 USD in token value would be reasonable.

### Impact

Users can MEV the system.
MEV bots can exploit swaps to extract value.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Don't have 0 as out, consider still applying some percentage of in as out
