# Out-of-sync check results in an over-utilised vault despite the guards against it

### Summary

Out-of-sync check results in an overutilized vault despite the guards against it

### Root Cause

Upon depositing to a vault using `LendingAssetVault::depositToVault()`, we have the following code:
```solidity
function depositToVault(address _vault, uint256 _amountAssets) external onlyOwner {
        ...
        uint256 _amountShares = IERC4626(_vault).deposit(_amountAssets, address(this));
        ...
        vaultDeposits[_vault] += _amountAssets;
        vaultUtilization[_vault] += _amountAssets;
        _totalAssetsUtilized += _amountAssets;
        ...
    }
```
Upon depositing in the underlying vault, we have the following check:
```solidity
uint256 _assetsUtilized = externalAssetVault.vaultUtilization(address(this));
bool _vaultOverUtilized = (1e18 * externalAssetVault.totalAssetsUtilized()) / externalAssetVault.totalAssets() > (1e18 * 8) / 10;
bool _pairOverAllocation = _assetsUtilized > externalAssetVault.vaultMaxAllocation(address(this));
if (_vaultOverUtilized || _pairOverAllocation) {
          uint256 _extAmount = _assetsUtilized > _amount ? _amount : _assetsUtilized;
          _withdrawToVault(_extAmount);
}
```
It checks the utilisation and off-boards an according amount if we are over-utilised. The issue is that the utilisation increases only happen after the deposit, thus we will be over-utilised despite the guards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. We deposit into a vault, we are currently at the maximum utilisation before off-boarding is required
2. We do not off-board as it is not required yet
3. As the increases are after the check, we are now over-utilised

### Impact

Vault over-utilisation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Refactor the code to not allow the mentioned issue in the report
