# `symbol` is not a part of the standart ERC20 methods and would simtimes revert

### Summary

`DIAOracleV2SinglePriceOracle::getPriceUSD18` would revert on some tokens like MKR which have name and symbol as bytes

### Root Cause

`DIAOracleV2SinglePriceOracle::getPriceUSD18` would revert on some tokens like `MKR` which has name and symbol set as bytes. 

The problem here is the bellow code which assumes that standard ERC20 tokens will have name and symbol at all:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/DIAOracleV2SinglePriceOracle.sol#L19
```solidity
        string memory _symbol = IERC20Metadata(_quoteToken).symbol();
```


When we call the name and symbol of MKR we will get 
https://etherscan.io/token/0x9f8f72aa9304c8b593d555f12ef6589cc3a579a2#readContract
`0x4d4b520000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` as symbol
`0x4d616b6572000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` as name

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Contract will not work with some tokens.

### Impact

`DIAOracleV2SinglePriceOracle`'s `getPriceUSD18` will not work with some tokens, like MKR. Meaning that `getPrices` will not work with such tokens (as it's uses `getPriceUSD18` down the line ).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make sure you add the `.symbol` or `.name` in a `try/catch`
