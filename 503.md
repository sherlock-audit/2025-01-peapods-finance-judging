# `setPartner` should reset `_partnerFirstWrapped` to zero

## Vulnerability Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L438-L441

When the partner is changed in `DecentralizedIndex.sol` using `setPartner`, `_partnerFirstWrapped` is **not** set to zero. So the new partner loses their first fee-free wrap.

Note that this **is not** an admin error as there are **no functions** to set `_partnerFirstWrapped` back to 0, hence there is **nothing** the admin can do to prevent this situation during a change of partner.

## Recommendation
Add a line `_partnerFirstWrapped = 0` into `setPartner` so that the new partner can rightfully have their first fee free wrap.
