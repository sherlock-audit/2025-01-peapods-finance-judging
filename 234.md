# LendingAssetVault.sol does not conform to ERC4626

### Summary
According to the readMe:
> Is the codebase expected to comply with any specific EIPs?
Many of our contracts implement ERC20 and ERC4626 which we attempt to comply with in the entirety of those standards for contracts that implement them.


Per EIP 4626's Security Considerations (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)
>Finally, ERC-4626 Vault implementers should be aware of the need for specific, opposing rounding directions across the different mutable and view methods, as it is considered most secure to favor the Vault itself during calculations over its users:
    • If (1) it’s calculating how many shares to issue to a user for a certain amount of the underlying tokens they provide or (2) it’s determining the amount of the underlying tokens to transfer to them for returning a certain amount of shares, it should round down.
    • If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round up.

Therefore, the result of the [previewMint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L116), [previewWithdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L132), [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L120) and [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L136) should be rounded up. However, these functions are rounded down breaking integration and causing the vault to lose value.

### Root Cause

The current implementation of [convertToShares()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L82) function will round down the number of shares returned due to how solidity handles Integer Division. ERC4626 expects the returned value of convertToShares to be rounded down. Thus, this function behaves as expected.
```solidity
 function convertToShares(uint256 _assets) public view override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _shares = (_assets * PRECISION) / _cbr();
    }
```
ERC 4626 expects the result returned from [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L136) function to be rounded up. However, within the [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L136) function, it calls the convertToShares function. Recall earlier that the convertToShares function returned a rounded down value, thus [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L136C5-L141C1) will return a rounded down value instead of round up value. Thus, this function does not behave as expected.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _assets, address _receiver, address _owner) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(address(0));
        _shares = convertToShares(_assets);
        _withdraw(_shares, _assets, _owner, _msgSender(), _receiver);
    }
```

Similar issue exists in other functions in vault like `mint`, `previewMint` and `previewWithdraw`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `previewWithdraw`, `withdraw`, `previewMint`, and `mint` returns a rounded down value instead of a rounded down value.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users and contracts interacting with the vault triggers the affected functions.

### Attack Path

Step 1: A user deposits assets into the vault. This increases the user's share balance.
Step 2: The user calls withdraw(_assets). The function rounds down the required _shares due to integer division.
Step 3: The user withdraws assets using withdraw(). Since withdraw() underestimates _shares, they burn fewer shares than they should.
Step 4: The use can repeat the process. By withdrawing and re-depositing multiple times, the user gradually extracts more assets than their actual shareholding allows. Also as many users or contracts interacts with the vault, the damage accumulates.
Step 5: The vault suffers from asset depletion.
Over time, the vaults distributes more assets than it should, leading to an imbalance where other users lose value.

Note: This attack path can apply to other functions that were affected like `previewWithdraw` which rounds down instead of rounding up.
### Impact

1. Users and other protocols that may integrate with the vault might wrongly assume that the functions handle rounding as per ERC4626 expectation. Therefore, it could cause some intergration problem as result of non-compliance with ERC4626 standard.
2. The vault will be shortchanged due to lose of value leading to loss of fund.

In conclusion, EIP4626 is aimed to create a consistent and robust implementation patterns for Tokenized Vaults. A slight deviation from 4626 would break composability and potentially lead to loss of fund (POC in https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/88 can be an example)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that the rounding of vault's functions behave as expected.
