# `LendingAssetVault::vaultUtilization` Could Be Inflated


### Summary
The `LendingAssetVault::vaultUtilization` represents the assets that the `LendingAssetVault` should receive from the `FraxlendPairVault`. 
The `vaultUtilization` should be updated after accounting for interest in the `FraxlendPairVault`. 
However, due to a missing update after accounting for interest, the `vaultUtilization` may become inflated.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L312-L317
```solidity
    function depositToVault(address _vault, uint256 _amountAssets) external onlyOwner {
        require(_amountAssets > 0);
312:    _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
313:    IERC20(_asset).safeIncreaseAllowance(_vault, _amountAssets);
314:    uint256 _amountShares = IERC4626(_vault).deposit(_amountAssets, address(this));
315:    require(totalAvailableAssetsForVault(_vault) >= _amountAssets, "MAX");
316:    vaultDeposits[_vault] += _amountAssets;
317:    vaultUtilization[_vault] += _amountAssets;
        _totalAssetsUtilized += _amountAssets;
        emit DepositToVault(_vault, _amountAssets, _amountShares);
    }
```
In line 314, the `FraxlendPairVault` account the interest.
In line 317, `vaultUtilization[_vault]` uses the value for the old `CBR` (not accounting for the new interest), while `_amountAssets` represents the value for the new `CBR`.
Therefore these values could not sum.

### PoC
Consider the following scenario:
In FraxlendPairVault: `totalAsset.amount = 100e18`, `totalAsset.shares = 100e18`, there are `10e18` unaccounted interest assets.
At this point, `LendingAssetVault::depositToVault(FraxlendPairVault, 55e18)` is called.

In `LendingAssetVault::L312`, `_vaultWhitelistCbr[FraxlendPairVault] = 1e27`.

In `LendingAssetVault::L314`, 
    The unaccounted interest in `FraxlendPairVault` is accounted and the assets are deposited.
    https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L628
    In `FraxlendPairVault`: 
        `totalAsset.amount = 110e18`, `totalAsset.shares = 100e18`, 
        `LendingAssetVault(externalAssetVault)'s shares = 55e18 * 100e18 / 110e18 = 50e18`,
        `LendingAssetVault(externalAssetVault)'s amount = 55e18`.

In LendingAssetVault::L317, vaultUtilization[FraxlendPairVault] = 55e18.

At this time, `_vaultWhitelistCbr[FraxlendPairVault] = 1e27` but the FraxlendPairVault's actual cbr is gretear than this value.

If `_updateAssetMetadataFromVault(FraxlendPairVault)` is called anywhere, 
    `_vaultWhitelistCbr[FraxlendPairVault] = 1e27 * 110e18 / 100e18 = 1.1e27`,
    https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L301-L303
    `vaultUtilization[FraxlendPairVault] = 55e18 + (55e18 * (1.1e27 - 1e27)) / 1e27 = 60.5e18`.
    However, in `FraxlendPairVault`, `LendingAssetVault(externalAssetVault)'s amount = 55e18`.
    And `totalAssets` is also inflated.

Additionally:
    The owner can call the `FraxlendPairVault::addInterest` function before calling `depositToVault`.
    https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L317
    However, if `rateChange < _currentUtilizationRate * minURChangeForExternalAddInterest / UTIL_PREC`, the `addInterest` function is skipped. 
    In contrast, the `_addInterest` function is always executed in the `deposit` function.

### Impact
If the `LendingAssetVault` could receive the asset amounts in all `vaultUtilization` from the `FraxlendPairVault`, this could lead to inflated `vaultUtilization`, resulting in:
1. Invariant Breaking: The `CBR` of `FraxlendPairVault` may decrease.
2. The providers in `FraxlendPairVault` could lose their assets.
3. The last providers in `LendingAssetVault` may be unable to withdraw their assets due to insufficient assets.

If not, due to inflated `totalAssets`:
4. The depositers in `LendingAssetVault` would receive fewer shares than they should.
5. The withdrawers in `LendingAssetVault` would receive more assets than they should.

### Mitigation
```diff
    function depositToVault(address _vault, uint256 _amountAssets) external onlyOwner {
        require(_amountAssets > 0);
-312:    _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
        IERC20(_asset).safeIncreaseAllowance(_vault, _amountAssets);
        uint256 _amountShares = IERC4626(_vault).deposit(_amountAssets, address(this));
        require(totalAvailableAssetsForVault(_vault) >= _amountAssets, "MAX");
        vaultDeposits[_vault] += _amountAssets;
+       _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
317:    vaultUtilization[_vault] += _amountAssets;
        _totalAssetsUtilized += _amountAssets;
        emit DepositToVault(_vault, _amountAssets, _amountShares);
    }
