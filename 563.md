# Attacker can gas grief user transactions by using rewards

### Summary

Attacker can gas grief user transactions by using rewards

### Root Cause

In [AutoCompoundingPodLp contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L213), every operation first call internal process reward function in order to convert the reward tokens to usable assets by using swap operations for every reward token. 

The problem is reward whitelist contract supports 12 tokens at max and those are choosen by the protocol. 

```solidity
contract RewardsWhitelist is IRewardsWhitelister, Ownable {
    uint8 constant MAX = 12;

    mapping(address => bool) public override isWhitelistedFromDebondFee;
```

If a token is whitelisted, any user can donate dust amount of token to Auto Compounding contract in order to process rewards.  This situation may cause gas grief attacks for the users because in single transaction all the reward functions are swaped to LP token in the end ( For single reward token there are 2 swap operation and 1 add liquidity operation).

```solidity
    function _processRewardsToPodLp(uint256 _amountLpOutMin, uint256 _deadline) internal returns (uint256 _lpAmtOut) {
        if (!yieldConvEnabled) {
            return _lpAmtOut;
        }
        address[] memory _tokens = ITokenRewards(IStakingPoolToken(_asset()).POOL_REWARDS()).getAllRewardsTokens();
        uint256 _len = _tokens.length + 1;
        for (uint256 _i; _i < _len; _i++) {
            address _token = _i == _tokens.length ? pod.lpRewardsToken() : _tokens[_i];
            uint256 _bal =
                IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (_token == pod.PAIRED_LP_TOKEN() ? _protocolFees : 0); // @audit-info gas griefing and DoS attacks
            if (_bal == 0) { // @audit after swap let say there are few wei tokens left - gas grief
                continue;
            }
            uint256 _newLp = _tokenToPodLp(_token, _bal, 0, _deadline);
            _lpAmtOut += _newLp;
        }
        _totalAssets += _lpAmtOut;
        require(_lpAmtOut >= _amountLpOutMin, "M");
    }
```

Get all reward tokens function works on token rewards contract but it can be easily added to token rewards contract by just simply depositing reward as an user.

```solidity
    function depositRewards(address _token, uint256 _amount) external override {
        _depositRewardsFromToken(_msgSender(), _token, _amount, true);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

1. Some reward tokens should be whitelisted by the protocol

### Attack Path

1. Firstly attacker deposit small amount of rewards to `TokenRewards` contract in order to active the tokens ( They are also whitelisted already )
2. And then attacker can donate each token to AutoCompoundingPodLP contract for reward processing
3. Let say the next caller is Alice will interact will Auto Compounding Pod LP. 
4. She should pay massive amount of gas fee for the execution, maybe transaction can also revert ( DoS )

### Impact

Loss of funds for the users, fee for swap operation may change in time but we can say that in normal chain conditions 3$ is paid for swap operation in mainnet. If there is 12 tokens, there will be 24 swap operation and 12 add liquidity operation. The user will pay massive amount of gas fee for the execution. It can also revert the transaction due to OOG issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is not trivial.
