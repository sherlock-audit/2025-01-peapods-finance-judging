# Price Oracle Manipulation

#### Issue Description
The protocol uses TWAP oracles with short intervals (10 minutes) to determine prices. These oracles are vulnerable to flash loan attacks, where an attacker can manipulate pool prices within the TWAP window to distort oracle readings.

#### Impact
Manipulating the oracle can lead to incorrect pricing, enabling attackers to exploit leverage operations, liquidations, or other financial mechanisms. Given the protocol's reliance on arbitrage bots and liquidations, this issue poses a significant risk to the system's integrity.

#### Proof of Concept
1. An attacker borrows a large amount of liquidity using a flash loan.
2. They manipulate the price of a token pair in a Uniswap V3 pool.
3. The TWAP oracle reads the manipulated price, causing incorrect calculations in the protocol.
4. The attacker exploits the distorted price to execute profitable trades or avoid liquidations.

#### Recommendation
Increase the TWAP interval to at least 1 hour to reduce the impact of short-term manipulations. Alternatively, use Chainlink as the primary oracle with TWAP as a secondary fallback.

```solidity
// Increase TWAP interval
uint32 constant INTERVAL = 1 hours;
```
