# Previous utilization rate is incorrectly calculated

### Summary

Previous utilization rate is incorrectly calculated

### Root Cause

In [FraxlendPairCore contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L457), previous utilization rate is incorrectly calculated because it substract the borrowing amount from the value and it makes the calculation completely wrong.

```solidity
        uint256 _totalAssetsAvailable = _totalAssetAvailable(totalAsset, totalBorrow, true);
        // @audit this is totally wrong because _totalAssetsAvailable
        // is counting the borrow amount and prevUtilization will always be higher than actual
        _prevUtilizationRate = _totalAssetsAvailable == 0 ? 0 : (UTIL_PREC * totalBorrow.amount) / _totalAssetsAvailable;
```

It makes the previous utilization rate is always higher than expected because in denominator _totalAssetsAvailable is the substracted version of available asset ( borrowing is substracted ).

### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

No need

### Impact

This variable is used for triggering the addInterest call by external vaults. If the difference exceeds the threshold it updates the rate. It will exceed the threshold unexpectedly and it will cause gas griefing for the user. Because this adjustment is designed for gas saving.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Calculate the previous rate without substracting the borrow amount
