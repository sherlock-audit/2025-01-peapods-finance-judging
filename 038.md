# Incorrect application of fees results in admin receiving more than supposed to

### Summary

Incorrect application of fees results in admin receiving more than supposed to

### Root Cause

Upon calling `TokenRewards::depositFromPairedLpToken()`, we have the following code:
```solidity
uint256 _adminAmt = _getAdminFeeFromAmount(_amountTkn);
        _amountTkn -= _adminAmt;

        if (LEAVE_AS_PAIRED_LP_TOKEN) {
            (, uint256 _yieldBurnFee) = _getYieldFees();
            uint256 _burnAmount = (_amountTkn * _yieldBurnFee) / PROTOCOL_FEE_ROUTER.protocolFees().DEN();
            _adminAmt += _burnAmount;
            _amountTkn -= _burnAmount;
            if (_adminAmt > 0) {
                _processAdminFee(_adminAmt);
            }
            _depositRewards(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN, _amountTkn);
            return;
        }
```
The function applies an admin fee to the token amount and then if `LEAVE_AS_PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is true, we apply a burn fee as well. The issue is that the burn amount is applied to the admin amount and is then simply transferred to him:
```solidity
    function _processAdminFee(uint256 _amount) internal {
        IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeTransfer(OwnableUpgradeable(address(V3_TWAP_UTILS)).owner(), _amount);
    }
```
This results in the admin receiving more than supposed to.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `TokenRewards::depositFromPairedLpToken()` is called and `LEAVE_AS_PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is true
2. We apply a 10% admin fee to 100 tokens, resulting in 90 tokens leftover and admin amount being 10
3. We then apply a 10% burn fee to the 90 tokens, resulting in 81 tokens leftover and admin amount going to 19
4. Admin unfairly receives 19 tokens

### Impact

Unfair distribution of the amount, users receive less rewards and admin receives more

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not give a burn fee to the admin
