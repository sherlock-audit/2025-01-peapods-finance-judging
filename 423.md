# `_getPoolFee()` gives you a zero fee for Arbitrum and passes it as a Uni V3 fee, giving it the impossibility of making the dex_adapter do the swap

### Summary

`_getPoolFee()` checks if the chain is Arbitrum and if so, gives a zero fee, otherwise the fee that the pool has.

The issue is that there is no such thing on Uni v3 as a zero fee trade and the function is used as a param in several places in `_zap()`, such as `__swapV3Single()`.

As seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Zapper.sol#L176-L178), this is being passed in the dex adapter as a pool fee and will be 100% revert, because no such thing exists as a zero fee tier, making it impossible to make swaps on Arbitrum

### Root Cause

The root cause is giving a zero fee when you are on Arbitrum for a Uni v3 trade, which is illogical as no 0% fee tier exists on Uni v3, regardless if it is on Arbitrum or not.



### Internal Pre-conditions

Chain must be Arbitrum

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Bob calls `addLeverage()` to add leverage, this function calls in itself `_lpAndStakeInPod()` -> `indexUtils::addLPAndStake()` -> `_zap()` which if has configured the pool to be a Uni v3 pool, will revert every single time it is being called due to trying to pass a zero fee as a fee tier

### Impact

User will be unable to use any functions with a Uni V3 pool that call `_zap()` and will revert.

Broken functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I would remove the function itself and just pass the fee that is in the pool as the else condition in its ternary operator, instead of giving a zero fee for Arbitrum.
