# Incorrect Fee Calculation Leading to Lower Burn Amount

### Summary

The current fee deduction logic in the TokenRewards contract results in an incorrect burn amount when depositing rewards. The burn fee is calculated after the admin fee has already been deducted, leading to a lower burn amount than expected. This results in an unintended distribution of tokens.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L149-L154 
- As seen above, the `_yieldBurnFee` is applied to `_amountTkn` after the _adminAmt has been deducted.
- This reduces the base value from which `_burnAmount` is derived, leading to a smaller burn fee than intended.
- The total deducted amount is less than the expected sum of admin and burn fees.

### for instance
- Initial tokens: 100
- _yieldAdminFee: 10%
- _yieldBurnFee: 10%

### Expected Calculation:
- Admin Fee = 10% of 100 = 10
- Burn Fee = 10% of 100 = 10
- Remaining Tokens = 100 - (10 + 10) = 80

### What's Wrong? (Current Code)
- Admin Fee is deducted first â†’ New balance = 90
- Burn Fee is now 10% of 90 = 9
- Remaining Tokens = 90 - 9 = 81

### Impact

The burn amount is lower than expected, reducing the deflationary effect intended by the burn mechanism.
The remaining tokens for distribution increase, leading to more tokens being circulated than designed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Calculate both `_adminAmt` and `_burnAmount` from the original `_amountTkn` before deducting them together.
