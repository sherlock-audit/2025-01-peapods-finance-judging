# incorrect use of `deadline` argument during swapping on uniswap and aerodrome.

### Summary

The protocol is using `block.timestamp` as the `deadline` argument while interacting with the UniswapV2 router, camelot  and AerdromeV2 router, which completely defeats the purpose of using a deadline.



### Root Cause

### **1.)  Instances of the bug in AerodromeDexAdapter**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/AerodromeDexAdapter.sol#L74-L77

```solidity
        IERC20(_tokenIn).safeIncreaseAllowance(V2_ROUTER, _amountIn);
        IAerodromeRouter(V2_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
            _amountIn, _amountOutMin, _routes, _recipient, block.timestamp
        );
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/AerodromeDexAdapter.sol#L100-L101

```solidity
        _inputs[0] = abi.encode(_recipient, _amountIn, _amountOutMin, _path, true);
        IAerodromeUniversalRouter(V3_ROUTER).execute(_commands, _inputs, block.timestamp);
```



### **2.) Instances of the bug in CamelotDexAdapter.sol** 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L48-L50

```solidity
        IERC20(_tokenIn).safeIncreaseAllowance(V2_ROUTER, _amountIn);
        ICamelotRouter(V2_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
            _amountIn, _amountOutMin, _path, _recipient, Ownable(address(V3_TWAP_UTILS)).owner(), block.timestamp
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L71-L72

```solidity 
        IERC20(_tokenIn).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(V2_ROUTER_UNI), _amountInMax);
        V2_ROUTER_UNI.swapTokensForExactTokens(_amountOut, _amountInMax, _path, _recipient, block.timestamp);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L96-L100

```solidity
            ISwapRouterAlgebra.ExactInputSingleParams({
                tokenIn: _tokenIn,
                tokenOut: _tokenOut,
                recipient: _recipient,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
```



### **3.) Instances of the bug in CamelotDexAdapter.sol** 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/UniswapDexAdapter.sol#L78-L79

```solidity
        IUniswapV2Router02(V2_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
            _amountIn, _amountOutMin, _path, _recipient, block.timestamp
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/UniswapDexAdapter.sol#L101-L103
```solidity 
        IUniswapV2Router02(V2_ROUTER).swapTokensForExactTokens(
            _amountOut, _amountInMax, _path, _recipient, block.timestamp
        );
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.) caller sends in tx
2.) block.timestamp is always the current block.timestamp supplied for tx deadline 

### External Pre-conditions

1.) caller sends in tx, 
2. ) gas user provides is lower than gas required to perform the swap tx on chain. 
3. ) the tx pends till a malicious miner executes it at a later/unfavourable time. 

### Attack Path

Using `block.timestamp` as the deadline is effectively a no-operation that has no effect nor protection. Since `block.timestamp` will take the timestamp value when the transaction gets mined, the check will end up comparing `block.timestamp` against the same value, see [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/697c2474757ea89fec12a4e6db16a574fe259610/contracts/base/PeripheryValidation.sol#L7), for example.



### Impact

Failure to provide a proper deadline value enables pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point. Transactions that provide an insufficient amount of gas such that they are not mined within a reasonable amount of time, can be picked by malicious actors or MEV bots and executed later in detriment of the submitter. See [[this issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-backed-findings/issues/64)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-backed-findings/issues/64) for an excellent reference on the topic.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

allow users specify a deadline amount in the function parameters
