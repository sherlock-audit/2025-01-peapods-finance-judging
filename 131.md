# Unclearable Dust Positions Due to minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation Threshold Causing Protocol Deadlock

### Summary and Impact
The FraxlendPair implementation can result in positions becoming permanently stuck in an insolvent state due to the `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation` threshold check in the liquidation function. When a borrower's leftover collateral falls into a specific range - positive but below `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation` - the position cannot be liquidated either partially or fully. This creates a deadlock where insolvent positions accumulate interest but cannot be cleared from the system.

This directly contradicts the protocol's core functionality as described in the documentation: "Fraxlend adheres to the EIP-4626: Tokenized Vault Standard... anyone [can] create and participate in lending and borrowing activities." The inability to liquidate certain positions violates this principle by preventing proper market operation and risk management.

### Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability exists in the liquidation logic within FraxlendPairCore.sol:

Here's a test demonstrating the issue:

```solidity
function testDustPositionDeadlock() public {
    // Setup initial borrowing position
    uint256 borrowAmount = 100 ether;
    uint256 collateralAmount = 110 ether;
    
    vm.startPrank(borrower);
    lendingPair.borrowAsset(borrowAmount, collateralAmount, borrower);
    
    // Price drops, making position insolvent
    mockExchangeRate(50 ether); // 50% price drop
    
    // Try to liquidate with amount that would leave dust
    vm.startPrank(liquidator);
    uint128 sharesToLiquidate = 90; // Calculated to leave dust
    
    // This reverts due to dust check
    vm.expectRevert("BadDirtyLiquidation");
    lendingPair.liquidate(sharesToLiquidate, block.timestamp + 1, borrower);
    
    // Position remains insolvent but can't be liquidated
    assertFalse(lendingPair._isSolvent(borrower, 50 ether));
}
```

The issue manifests when:
1. A position becomes insolvent due to price movement
2. The liquidation attempt would leave collateral above 0 but below `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation`
3. The transaction reverts, leaving the position stuck

This creates a permanent deadlock because:
- Partial liquidation reverts due to dust check
- Full liquidation isn't triggered because leftover collateral is positive
- The position remains insolvent and accumulates interest
- Protocol cannot recover the borrowed assets

### Tools Used
- Manual Review
- Foundry

### Recommendations

Add a fallback mechanism for dust positions.
