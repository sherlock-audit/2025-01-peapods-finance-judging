# Missing collateral health checks in `LeverageManager.withdrawAssets` will cause bad debt accumulation as users withdraw below liquidation thresholds

### Summary

**The lack of post-withdrawal collateral validation in `LeverageManager.withdrawAssets` will lead to protocol insolvency as attackers withdraw collateral from positions with insufficient safety margins.** This allows strategic removal of collateral assets even when positions are near liquidation levels, creating systemic undercollateralization that liquidation mechanisms cannot resolve, ultimately resulting in unrecoverable lender funds.

### Root Cause

In function `LeverageManager.withdrawAssets`([`LeverageManager.sol#L199-L204`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L199-L204)) the withdrawal function lacks collateral health validation before allowing asset removal. The `withdrawAssets` function calls `LeveragePositionCustodian.withdraw` which transfers collateral tokens without checking if the position remains sufficiently collateralized after withdrawal. This allows position owners to drain collateral even when their debt-to-collateral ratio exceeds safe thresholds, bypassing liquidation protections.

```solidity
contract LeverageManager is ILeverageManager, IFlashLoanRecipient, Context, LeverageManagerAccessControl {
		// ...
		
    function withdrawAssets(uint256 _positionId, address _token, address _recipient, uint256 _amount)
        external
        onlyPositionOwner(_positionId)
    {
        LeveragePositionCustodian(positionProps[_positionId].custodian).withdraw(_token, _recipient, _amount);
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

```solidity
contract LeveragePositionCustodian is Context, Ownable {
		// ...
		
    function withdraw(address _token, address _recipient, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
        _amount = _amount == 0 ? IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) : _amount;
        IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);
    }
}
```

The missing health factor check creates a protocol-level vulnerability where undercollateralized positions could accumulate bad debt that cannot be liquidated. Proper lending protocols should validate collateral ratios remain above liquidation thresholds during any asset removal operations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol allows direct collateral withdrawals without checking debt-to-collateral ratios
2. Leveraged positions maintain debt obligations separate from collateral tracking
3. No minimum collateral threshold enforcement during asset removal operations

### External Pre-conditions

1. Existence of leveraged positions with collateral value barely above liquidation thresholds
2. Market conditions where collateral assets experience price volatility (e.g. ETH drops 5% daily)
3. Custodian contracts hold sufficient liquid collateral assets (e.g. $500k USDC in custody)

### Attack Path

1. Attacker opens leveraged position with $100k collateral supporting $80k debt (125% collateral ratio)
2. Market dip reduces collateral value to $85k (106% ratio, near 100% liquidation threshold)
3. Attacker withdraws $10k collateral via `withdrawAssets` without repayment
4. Position collateral drops to $75k against $80k debt (93% ratio - undercollateralized)
5. Protocol liquidation mechanisms fail to recover full debt due to insufficient collateral
6. Repeat across multiple positions to create systemic undercollateralization

### Impact

Protocol lenders face direct financial loss from unrecoverable debt. For example:
- Total protocol TVL: $10M with $8M borrowed
- Attacker drains 15% collateral ($1.5M) from leveraged positions
- Creates $1.2M bad debt (15% of $8M loans) that cannot be liquidated
- Lenders lose 12% of deposited funds ($1.2M/$10M)
- Protocol becomes insolvent requiring emergency shutdown

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement collateral health checks before allowing withdrawals:
1. Add debt-to-collateral ratio validation in `LeverageManager.withdrawAssets`
2. Require post-withdrawal collateral ratio ≥ liquidation threshold (e.g. 110%)
3. Integrate with existing liquidation system to calculate remaining collateral value
4. Revert transaction if withdrawal would push position below safe collateral levels

Example modification flow:
- Calculate current collateral value and debt obligations
- Subtract withdrawal amount from collateral value
- Verify (collateral - withdrawal) / debt ≥ minimum ratio
- Only proceed with transfer if validation passes
