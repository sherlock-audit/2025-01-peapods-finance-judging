# AutoCompoundingLp::_processRewardsToPodLp doesnt claim unclaimed rewards from TokenRewards before processing rewards to asset

### Summary

The AutoCompoundingLp contract fails to properly account for accrued rewards in the TokenRewards contract when processing rewards. Specifically, it does not call TokenRewards.claimRewards() before executing 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L213C14-L213C36
_processRewardsToPodLp. This results in two key issues:

During Deposits: New depositors can unfairly claim a share of unclaimed rewards intended for previous depositors.

During Withdrawals: Users withdrawing their assets may receive fewer tokens than they are entitled to, as unclaimed rewards are not included in the totalAssets calculation.

This lack of proper reward accrual undermines the fairness of the protocol and negatively impacts both depositors and withdrawers.



### Root Cause

The root cause is the absence of a call to TokenRewards._distributeRewards() either viaTokenRewards._distributeRewards()  or via token transfer before or during the execution of _processRewardsToPodLp. As a result, rewards accrued in the TokenRewards contract are not reflected in the AutoCompoundingLp contract's totalAssets when processing deposits or withdrawals.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

A user interacts with the AutoCompoundingLp contract (e.g., deposits or withdraws assets).

The TokenRewards contract has a non-zero balance of reward tokens allocated to the AutoCompoundingLp contract.



### Attack Path

Scenario 1: Unfair Reward Sniping During Deposits
A user deposits asset tokens into the AutoCompoundingLp contract while unclaimed rewards are still held in the TokenRewards contract.

The AutoCompoundingLp contract processes rewards by calling _processRewardsToPodLp, but it does not claim the accrued rewards from the TokenRewards contract.

The user immediately withdraws their deposit, claiming a share of the unclaimed rewards that were not accounted for in the totalAssets calculation.

Scenario 2: Incorrect Withdrawal Amounts
A user attempts to withdraw their assets from the AutoCompoundingLp contract.

The AutoCompoundingLp contract processes rewards but does not claim accrued rewards from the TokenRewards contract.

The user receives fewer tokens than they are entitled to, as the unclaimed rewards are not included in the totalAssets calculation.


### Impact
Unfair Reward Distribution: New depositors can "snip" unclaimed rewards intended for previous depositors by depositing and withdrawing at strategic times.

Incorrect Withdrawal Amounts: Users withdrawing their assets may receive fewer tokens than they are entitled to, as unclaimed rewards are not included in the totalAssets calculation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. call rewardToken.claimRewards before _processRewardsToPodLp 
2. transfer asset token at the start of the external call to trigger _distributeRewards
