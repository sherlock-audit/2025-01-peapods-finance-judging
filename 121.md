# L0ckin7 - Potential Front-Running in `setPoolRewards` and `setStakingToken`

### Summary

The `setPoolRewards` and `setStakingToken` functions are designed to set critical addresses (`POOL_REWARDS` and `stakingToken`) in the contract. These functions can only be called once, as they include a check to ensure the address is not already set. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/StakingPoolToken.sol#L83

```solidity
require(POOL_REWARDS == address(0), "I"); // In setPoolRewards
require(stakingToken == address(0), "S"); // In setStakingToken
```
However, these functions are vulnerable to front-running attacks. 

### Impact

This can lead to loss of funds or control over the staking pool.

### Attack Path

An attacker could monitor the blockchain for transactions calling these functions and submit their own transaction with a higher gas price to replace the intended address with their own.
This could lead to `POOL_REWARDS` or `stakingToken` address being set to a malicious contract.

 ### Recommendations

Propose Step:

The owner proposes a new address for `POOL_REWARDS` or `stakingToken` using `proposePoolRewards` or `proposeStakingToken`.
The proposed address is stored in `proposedPoolRewards` or `proposedStakingToken`.

Confirm Step:

The owner confirms the proposed address using `confirmPoolRewards` or `confirmStakingToken`.
The proposed address is set as the actual `POOL_REWARDS` or `stakingToken`, and the proposed address is reset to `address(0)`.

Events are emitted at each step to track the proposal and confirmation process.

```solidity
// Add proposed addresses for two-step setting
address public proposedPoolRewards;
address public proposedStakingToken;

// Events for tracking proposals and confirmations
event PoolRewardsProposed(address indexed proposedRewards);
event PoolRewardsConfirmed(address indexed confirmedRewards);
event StakingTokenProposed(address indexed proposedToken);
event StakingTokenConfirmed(address indexed confirmedToken);

// Two-step process for setting POOL_REWARDS
function proposePoolRewards(address _rewards) external onlyOwner {
    require(POOL_REWARDS == address(0), "Already set");
    proposedPoolRewards = _rewards;
    emit PoolRewardsProposed(_rewards);
}

function confirmPoolRewards() external onlyOwner {
    require(proposedPoolRewards != address(0), "No proposal");
    POOL_REWARDS = proposedPoolRewards;
    proposedPoolRewards = address(0); // Reset the proposed address
    emit PoolRewardsConfirmed(POOL_REWARDS);
}

// Two-step process for setting stakingToken
function proposeStakingToken(address _stakingToken) external onlyOwner {
    require(stakingToken == address(0), "Already set");
    proposedStakingToken = _stakingToken;
    emit StakingTokenProposed(_stakingToken);
}

function confirmStakingToken() external onlyOwner {
    require(proposedStakingToken != address(0), "No proposal");
    stakingToken = proposedStakingToken;
    proposedStakingToken = address(0); // Reset the proposed address
    emit StakingTokenConfirmed(stakingToken);
}
```
