# No usable DexAdapter for Kim swap on Mode.


### Summary

No usable DexAdapter for Kim swap on Mode.

### Root Cause

On Mode chain, the [Kim swap](https://docs.kim.exchange/) will be used. Currently there is no KimDexAdapter, only UniswapDexAdapter, AerodromeDexAdapter, CamelotDexAdapter. One would expect Kim swap can reuse one of the existing adapters, however, none can be reused. In fact, from the pPEAS pod on Mode chain, we can see it reuses the CamelotDexAdapter: https://explorer.mode.network/token/0x064efc5cb0b7bc52ac9e717ea5f3f35f3534f855?tab=read_contract

Kim swap's V2 is a fork of UniswapV2, V3 is a fork of AlgebraIntegral (which is also a fork of UniswapV3 with modificatons).

Unlike Uniswap V2, the V2_ROUTER of Camelot/Kim does not by default support the exact output feature, which is the `swapTokensForExactTokens()` function. See [CamelotRouter](https://github.com/CamelotLabs/periphery/blob/main/contracts/CamelotRouter.sol#L246) does not contain this feature. In order to fix this, the `swapV2SingleExactOut()` was overridden and uses a new `V2_ROUTER_UNI` to support this (this is the address of the Uniswap V2 Router).

The bug here is, the contract address of `V2_ROUTER_UNI` is hardcoded to the address for Camelot (on Arbitrum chain), when it should be another address on Mode chain. Thus if we deploy this on Mode chain, it will simply not work.

This will affect the `swapV2SingleExactOut()` function, which is used in LVF when remove leverage for pTKN -> pairedLpTKN swaps. This is not launched yet, so it explains why this issue did not occur already.
