# `AutoCompoundingPodlLp` does not support self-lending Pod with podded pair

### Summary

`AutoCompoundingPodlLp` does not support self-lending Pods with podded pair and as a result LVF(leveraged volatility farming) cannot be used on these Pods even though they are supported by `LeverageManager`


### Root Cause

There are 2 types of self-lending Pods

1. self-lending pod with fToken(lending-pair) pair
2. self-lending pod with podded fToken(lending-pair) pair.

While both of these are supported by `LeverageManager` , `AutoCompoundingPodlLp` only supports self-lending pods with fToken(lending-pair) pair.
The issue here is that `AutoCompoundingPodlLp`(**aspTkn**) is **required** for leveraged volatility farming, meaning that self-lending pods with podded fToken pair cannot be used for LVF.

**Where or How exactly does `AutoCompoundingPodlLp` not support self-lending pods with podded fToken pair?**
In `AutoCompoundingPodlLp::_tokenToPairedLpToken` a function that converts reward tokens to the paired token of the Pod, as seen here:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L261

```solidity
function _tokenToPairedLpToken(address _token, uint256 _amountIn) internal returns (uint256 _amountOut) {
	address _pairedLpToken = pod.PAIRED_LP_TOKEN();
	address _swapOutputTkn = _pairedLpToken;
	if (_token == _pairedLpToken) {
		return _amountIn;
	} else if (maxSwap[_token] > 0 && _amountIn > maxSwap[_token]) {
		_amountIn = maxSwap[_token];
	}

	// if self lending pod, we need to swap for the lending pair borrow token,
	// then deposit into the lending pair which is the paired LP token for the pod
	if (IS_PAIRED_LENDING_PAIR) {
		_swapOutputTkn = IFraxlendPair(_pairedLpToken).asset(); // <@ audit
	}

	address _rewardsToken = pod.lpRewardsToken();
	if (_token != _rewardsToken) {
		_amountOut = _swap(_token, _swapOutputTkn, _amountIn, 0);
		if (IS_PAIRED_LENDING_PAIR) {
			_amountOut = _depositIntoLendingPair(_pairedLpToken, _swapOutputTkn, _amountOut); // <@ audit
		}
		return _amountOut;
	}
	//...SNIP...
}

function _depositIntoLendingPair(address _lendingPair, address _pairAsset, uint256 _depositAmt) internal returns (uint256 _shares) {
	IERC20(_pairAsset).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(_lendingPair), _depositAmt);
	_shares = IFraxlendPair(_lendingPair).deposit(_depositAmt, address(this)); // <@ audit
}
```

As explained, there is no `asset` or `deposit` function in a Pod, so these function calls(only the first call is enough) will DOS any interaction with `AutoCompoundingPodlLp` if pod has podded fToken pair.

It is important to note that this function is called internally on every `deposit`/`withdraw`/`mint`/`redeem` transaction to the `AutoCompoundingPodlLp` contract.


### Internal Pre-conditions

pod's PAIRED_LP_TOKEN is a podded fToken


### External Pre-conditions

NONE

### Attack Path

NONE

### Impact

High - Broken functionality - the primary existence of self-lending pods is for LVF and Pods can't LVF without aspTkn(`AutoCompoundingPodlLp`)


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add support for self-lending Pods with podded pair
