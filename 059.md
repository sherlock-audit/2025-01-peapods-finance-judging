# Liquidators won't always liquidate positions

### Summary

Liquidators will sometimes get unprofitable liquidations due to the way protocol fee is taken, this will lower liquidations and push the system into reaching bad debt more easily.

Fees are taken from liquidator's collateral, which would decrease it's earning and may even make liquidations unprofitable in some cases.

The code snippet bellow shows how  we:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1132-L1157
```solidity
            // get liquidator's liquidating assets
            uint256 _liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits =
                ((_totalBorrow.toAmount(_sharesToLiquidate, false) * _exchangeRate) / EXCHANGE_PRECISION);

            // calculate the fee he would get for executing the task
            uint256 _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator =
                (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + cleanLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;

             // get leftover and make sure we aren't getting more collateral than the user has
            _leftoverCollateral = (_userCollateralBalance.toInt256() - _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator.toInt256());

            _collateralForLiquidator = _leftoverCollateral <= 0
                ? _userCollateralBalance
                : (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + dirtyLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;

            // calculate the protocol fee from liquidator's final amount
            if (protocolLiquidationFee > 0) {
                _feesAmount = (protocolLiquidationFee * _collateralForLiquidator) / LIQ_PRECISION;
                _collateralForLiquidator = _collateralForLiquidator - _feesAmount;
            }
```

However since we are taking the fee from the liquidator's final amount that protocol fee is applied on a bigger value (coll + liquidator fee), thus having more impact and being proportionally bigger.

### Root Cause

Taking the fee from the liquidator's final amount

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1149-L1151
```solidity
            if (protocolLiquidationFee > 0) {
                _feesAmount = (protocolLiquidationFee * _collateralForLiquidator) / LIQ_PRECISION;
                _collateralForLiquidator = _collateralForLiquidator - _feesAmount;
            }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Protocol and liquidator fees are 10% each
2. Liquidator liquidates 10k worth of assets
3. We math out his `_collateralForLiquidator` to be worth 11k
4. Fees would be 11k * 10% -> 1.1k
5. Final `_collateralForLiquidator` would be 9.9k making the liquidation bad for the liquidator

### Impact

Liquidators will sometimes get unprofitable liquidations due to the way protocol fee is taken, this will lower liquidations and push the system into reaching bad debt more easily.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Take the fee from the amount before the increase.
