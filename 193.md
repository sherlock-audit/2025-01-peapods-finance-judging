# `removeLeverage`  function in `LeverageManager` contract might fail because of rounding down in shares calculation

### Summary

In `removeLeverage` function, it swaps `pTkn` into `borrowTkn` to repay flash loan. When the pod has self-lending pair, it swaps `pTkn` into `fBorrowAsset` and then redeems borrow asset from fraxlend pair. However, when calculating the amount of `fBorrowAsset` to redeem, it uses `convertToShares` function of `fraxlendPair` contract. Since `convertToShares` uses rounding down in division, it might provide less borrow asset than required in `redeem` function, thus failing to repay flash loan.

### Root Cause

The root cause is because of using [`convertToShares`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L439) in calculating output amount of swap.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The pod has self-lending pair

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Alice wants to remove leverage from her position, thus calling `removeLeverage` function
- The pod has self-lending pair, e.g. borrow asset is `DAI` which makes the lending-pair `fDAI`
- Let's say Alice needs to pay 1000 DAI to repay flash loan, but she's got 900 DAI from unstaking
- Some amount of `pTkn` needs to be swapped into 100 DAI to fill flash loan payback amount
- Since it's self-lending pair, `pTkn / fDAI` pair exists in Uniswap V2, so it converts `DAI` to `fDAI` using `convertToShares`
- After `pTkn` is swapped into `fDAI`, `redeem` is called to retrieve `DAI` from `fDAI`, but it also does rounding down
- At the end, the DAI amounts retrieved is less than 100 DAI, perhaps 99.9999... DAI
- As a result, 1000 DAI flash loan payback amount can't be satisfied
- `removeLeverage` reverts

### Impact

Users can't remove leverage from their position, thus causing DoS.

### Mitigation

Instead of using `convertToShares`, use `toAssetShares` function of `fraxlendPair` contract.

```diff
        if (_borrowAmtNeededToSwap > 0) {
            if (_isPodSelfLending(_props.positionId)) {
                _podAmtRemaining = _swapPodForBorrowToken(
                    _pod,
                    positionProps[_props.positionId].lendingPair,
                    _podAmtReceived,
-                   IFraxlendPair(positionProps[_props.positionId].lendingPair).convertToShares(_borrowAmtNeededToSwap),
+                   IFraxlendPair(positionProps[_props.positionId].lendingPair).toAssetShares(_borrowAmtNeededToSwap, true, true),
                    _podSwapAmtOutMin
                );
                IFraxlendPair(positionProps[_props.positionId].lendingPair).redeem(
                    IERC20(positionProps[_props.positionId].lendingPair).balanceOf(address(this)),
                    address(this),
                    address(this)
                );
            } else {
                _podAmtRemaining = _swapPodForBorrowToken(
                    _pod, _borrowToken, _podAmtReceived, _borrowAmtNeededToSwap, _podSwapAmtOutMin
                );
            }
        }
```
