# `staleAfterLastRefresh` is hardcoded to the wrong value

### Summary

`staleAfterLastRefresh` is hardcoded to 60min, however nowhere in the [DIA docs](https://docs.diadata.org/use-nexus-product/nexus/data-delivery-usage) is this threshold mentioned. We can see that the standard feed update time is 2min, making the 60min mark outdated.


Example of an oracles:
ETH - update frequency 120s ->  https://www.diadata.org/app/price/asset/Ethereum/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000/
BTC - update frequency 120s -> https://www.diadata.org/app/price/asset/Bitcoin/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000/

### Root Cause

DIA standard oracle price updates are every 2min, meaning that a price 20 or 30 minutes old would be considered stale, however our oracle would count it as fresh.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/DIAOracleV2SinglePriceOracle.sol#L8-L24
```solidity    
contract DIAOracleV2SinglePriceOracle is ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle {
    uint256 public staleAfterLastRefresh = 60 minutes;

    constructor(address _sequencer) ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle(_sequencer) {}

    function getPriceUSD18(
        address _clBaseConversionPoolPriceFeed,
        address _quoteToken,
        address _quoteDIAOracle,
        uint256
    ) external view virtual override returns (bool _isBadData, uint256 _price18) {
        string memory _symbol = IERC20Metadata(_quoteToken).symbol();

        (uint128 _quotePrice8, uint128 _refreshedLast) =
            IDIAOracleV2(_quoteDIAOracle).getValue(string.concat(_symbol, "/USD"));

        if (_refreshedLast + staleAfterLastRefresh < block.timestamp) {
            _isBadData = true;
        }
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

There is no attack path, just the oracle `staleAfterLastRefresh` is hard coded to 1 value for all oracles. It's also the wrong value.

### Impact

Oracle can have outdated price and our `DIAOracleV2SinglePriceOracle` would still consider it fresh. This will prob. lead to problems with liquidation (early/late) inside frax or improper slippage accounting inside `AutoCompoundingPodLp`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider changing it to default of 2min and add a mapping for every oracle to have it's own `staleAfterLastRefresh` in case any custom ones were to be used in the future.
