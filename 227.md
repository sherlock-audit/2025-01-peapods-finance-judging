# Missing slippage when debonding will cause a serious loss for the last withdrawer

### Summary

Missing slippage when debonding will cause a serious loss for the last withdrawer

### Root Cause

Debonding from a pod has a debonding fee for every withdrawer except the last one (or if whitelisted from debond fee):
```solidity
 uint256 _amountAfterFee = _isLastOut(_amount) || REWARDS_WHITELIST.isWhitelistedFromDebondFee(_msgSender()) ? _amount : (_amount * (DEN - _fees.debond)) / DEN;
```
This means that the last withdrawer can be either maliciously or accidentally frontran by another user depositing which will result in a direct loss for him as he will incur a debonding fee unexpectedly. The losses with a debonding fee of 2% are close to 2% and close to 50\$ (assuming token is WETH at 2500\$ price) which pass the criteria for high severity according to the docs (required for high is 1% and 10\$), you can check POC to confirm.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User withdraws as last withdrawor, he gets frontran by another user who deposits, either maliciously or accidentally

### External Pre-conditions

No such

### Attack Path

Attack path is somewhat clear, the issue is simple. Check the POC section to see it however and see the exact loss as well.

### Impact

Loss of funds, 48\$ and ~2% if the debonding fee is 2% which is perfectly normal and expected, these numbers are sufficient of High severity.

### PoC

Paste the following function in `DecentralizedIndex` so we can set the fee:
```solidity
function setFees() public {
        _fees.debond = 200;
    }
```
Then, paste the following POC in `WeightedIndex.t.sol`:
```solidity
        function testNoSlippageLoss() public {
        assertEq(pod.totalSupply(), 0); // Empty pod
        IDecentralizedIndex.IndexAssetInfo[] memory assets = pod.getAllAssets();
        assertEq(assets.length, 1); // 1 token
        pod.setFees();
        /* ADDED THE BELOW FUNCTION, 2% DEBOND FEE
        function setFees() public {
            _fees.debond = 200;
        }
        */

        address user1 = makeAddr('user1');
        address user2 = makeAddr('user2');
        address token = assets[0].token;

        deal(token, user1, 1e18);
        deal(token, user2, 1e18);

        uint256 initialBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(user1);
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        IERC20(token).approve(address(pod), type(uint256).max);
        pod.bond(token, 1e18, 0); // User 1 deposits
        vm.stopPrank();

        // User1 wants to withdraw but gets frontran by the user2 deposit!
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        IERC20(token).approve(address(pod), type(uint256).max);
        pod.bond(token, 1e18, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        assertEq(pod.balanceOf(user1), 1e18);
        address[] memory x = new address[](0);
        uint8[] memory y = new uint8[](0);
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        pod.debond(pod.balanceOf(user1), x, y);
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(pod.balanceOf(user1), 0);

        console.log("Percentage loss in 1e18 format:");
        console.log((initialBalance - IERC20(token).balanceOf(user1)) * 1e18 / initialBalance); // % loss
        console.log("Dollar loss:");
        console.log((initialBalance - IERC20(token).balanceOf(user1)) * 2500 / 1e18); // Dollar loss assuming ETH price is 2500$
    }
```

LOGS:
```solidity
Percentage loss in 1e18 format:
19509754877438720
Dollar loss:
48
```


### Mitigation

Add slippage when debonding whether a user is fine with getting charged a debonding fee
