# When LeverageManager uses PodFlashSource as the flash loan source, DoS will always occur for the functionality of addLeverage and removeLeverage.

## Vulnerability Details

For the removeLeverage and addLeverage functionalities, we need to use a flash loan. see
[here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L189) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L302). This `flash` function will ultimately `call back` the LeverageManager to finalize the post-effects, depending on whether we are adding leverage or removing leverage.

When we set the flash loan source to PodFlashSource, the lock modifier in the flash function will set the unlocked flag to 0. Then, within the same transaction, when we call `_addLeveragePostCallback` or `_removeLeveragePostCallback`, all subsequent logic, including `bond/debond/addLpAndStake/unstakeAndRemoveLp`, will experience a denial of service (DoS) because the `lock` modifier has been applied, which requires unlocked != 0.

## Impact

DoS in addLeverage&removeLeverage with PodVault as flash source.

## Recommended mitigation

Consider that if the `_recipient` for `DecentralizedIndex::flash` is `PodFlashSource`, then a different logic will be applied to execute addLeverage/removeLeverage.
