# Last position's liquidation price is incorrectly calculated

### Summary

Last position's liquidation price is incorrectly calculated

### Root Cause

In [spTKNMinimalOracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L185), the debond fee is substracted from the price calculation. But we already know that the last withdrawer is not impacted from debond fee, so actually spTKN/base price is calculated less than actual

```solidity

    function _calculateBasePerPTkn(uint256 _price18) internal view returns (uint256 _basePerPTkn18) {
        // pull from UniV3 TWAP if passed as 0
        if (_price18 == 0) {
            bool _isBadData;
            (_isBadData, _price18) = _getDefaultPrice18(); // USDC / WETH = 3000e18 USDC
            if (_isBadData) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        _basePerPTkn18 = _accountForCBRInPrice(pod, underlyingTkn, _price18);  

        // adjust current price for spTKN pod unwrap fee, which will end up making the end price
        // (spTKN per base) higher, meaning it will take more spTKN to equal the value
        // of base token. This will more accurately ensure healthy LTVs when lending since
        // a liquidation path will need to account for unwrap fees
&>      _basePerPTkn18 = _accountForUnwrapFeeInPrice(pod, _basePerPTkn18); 
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Last pod token owner's position is slightly higher than max LTV

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

1. The last pTKN's owner's position in lending pair is slightly higher than max LTV
2. It should be liquidated normally because there is no debond fee for the last pTKN owner but the oracle will substract the fee
3. It can't be liquidated in current situation

### Impact

A position which should be liquidateable can't be liquidated

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not apply the debond fee for the last pTKN's owner's position
