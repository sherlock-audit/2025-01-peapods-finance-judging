# `_protocolFees` can be applied multiple times in `AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract

### Summary

In the `_processRewardsToPodLp` function, the reward token is swapped to `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN`, and then some of it is paid as `_protocolFees`. The remaining `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is swapped to `pod` and `StakingPoolToken`. However, if this swap fails, `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` remains in the contract as it is.
`PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` can also be reward token, and in case of `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN`, the same operation is done for `balanceOf(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN) - _protocolFees`. 
If the previous reward token is swapped to `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` and then the swap to `pod` and `StakingPoolToken` fails, the remaining token amount is included in `balanceOf(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN)`, and `_protocolFees` is paid again for this amount..

### Root Cause

If the swap from `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` to `pod` and `StakingPoolToken` fails, `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` [remains](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L341-L342) in the contract as it is. (let's call this `swapFaildAmount`)

In case of [`PAIRED_LP_TOKEN`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L221-L222), the `swapFaildAmount` is included to `IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this))` and `IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) - _protocolFees` is swapped to PodLp while paying protocol fee for `swapFaildAmount` again.
This means that the protocol fee is paid twice for the previous reward token.

For `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN`, if the swap to `pod` and `StakingPoolToken` also fails, the protocol fee will be applied again next time.


### Internal Pre-conditions

swap from `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` to `pod` fails

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol fee can be paid multiple times, reducing the reward for users.

### PoC

RewardsTokens = [PAIRED_LP_TOKEN, dai, lpRewardsToken]

1. In prev call of `_processRewardsToPodLp` function:
`lpRewardsToken` is swapped to 50 of `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN`, and 5 is paid for protocol fee. Total protocol fee increases from 0 to 5.
And then the rest 45 of `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is used for swap to `Pod` but this swap failed.
`swapFaildAmount` = 45, balance of `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` = 45, `_protocolFee` = 5
2. 40 of `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is distributed to `AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract and the balance of `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is increased to 85 from 45.
3. In next call of `_processRewardsToPodLp` function:
80(=85-_protocolFee) of `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is used for swap and protocol fee is also paid for the `swapFaildAmount`.

This means for previous `lpRewardsToken` with same worth of 50 `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN`, total paid fee is 50 / 10 + 45 / 10 = 9.5.
To be correct, the fee should be paid only for the newly distributed `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` of 40.

### Mitigation

The protocol fee must be paid only if the swap to `PodLp` is successful.
Or keep track of the amount of `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` remaining in the contract if the swap fails.
