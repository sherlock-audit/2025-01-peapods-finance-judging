# `_removeLeveragePostCallback` will revert if the borrowers is trying to close 100% of the position

### Summary

If the borrower is trying to close 100% of his position, the flow will most likely revert as the provided amounts won't be enough due to interest accrual.  

### Root Cause

When calling `removeLeverage` borrowers select the amount of assets they want to repay, where these assets are converted in shares

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L181-L188
```solidity
        bytes memory _additionalInfo = abi.encode(
            IFraxlendPair(_lendingPair).totalBorrow().toShares(_borrowAssetAmt, false), // note that assets are converted in shares
            _collateralAssetRemoveAmt,
            _podAmtMin,
            _pairedAssetAmtMin,
            _podSwapAmtOutMin,
            _userProvidedDebtAmtMax
        );
```

Later these shares would be used to repay the position:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L353-L372
```solidity
        (
            uint256 _borrowSharesToRepay,
            uint256 _collateralAssetRemoveAmt,
            uint256 _podAmtMin,
            uint256 _pairedAssetAmtMin,
            uint256 _podSwapAmtOutMin,
            uint256 _userProvidedDebtAmtMax
        ) = abi.decode(_additionalInfo, (uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256));

        LeveragePositionProps memory _posProps = positionProps[_props.positionId];
        IFraxlendPair(_posProps.lendingPair).repayAsset(_borrowSharesToRepay, _posProps.custodian);

```


When we check with Frax lend `_repay` we see that if we try to repay more shares than the borrower owns the TX reverts:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1023
```solidity
    function _repayAsset(
        VaultAccount memory _totalBorrow,
        uint128 _amountToRepay,
        uint128 _shares,
        address _payer,
        address _borrower
    ) internal {
        _totalBorrow.amount -= _amountToRepay;
        _totalBorrow.shares -= _shares;

        userBorrowShares[_borrower] -= _shares;
        totalBorrow = _totalBorrow;
```

And if we try to remove 100% of our collateral while still having some shares the TX would revert as we would be undercollateralized:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L993-L1007
```solidity
    function removeCollateral(uint256 _collateralAmount, address _receiver)
        external
        nonReentrant
        isSolvent(msg.sender)
    {
        if (_receiver == address(0)) revert InvalidReceiver();
        _addInterest();

        if (userBorrowShares[msg.sender] > 0) {
            (bool _isBorrowAllowed,,) = _updateExchangeRate();
            if (!_isBorrowAllowed) revert ExceedsMaxOracleDeviation();
        }
        _removeCollateral(_collateralAmount, _receiver, msg.sender);
    }
```


However if our initial removing TX gets executed a few blocks later our shares would have accumulated some interest meaning that our initial amount won't close 100% of the borrowed shares, preventing us from withdrawing 100% of our collateral.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none, this will happen every time

### External Pre-conditions

The borrower to want to close his entire position in one TX.

### Attack Path

1. One share is valued at 1.05 assets 
2. Borrower wants to repay his full debt which is currently 100k shares and when converted into assets - 105k.
3. He calls `removeLeverage` with 105k assets and removes 100% of his collateral
4. The TX is executed a few blocks later, however due to the time difference the share increases it's value to 1.05002 assets , which is 2 USD for 100k shares
5 . Due to the increase `removeLeverage` calculate the shares our borrower wants to repay as `105k / 1.05002 = 99998.09`

```solidity
        bytes memory _additionalInfo = abi.encode(
            IFraxlendPair(_lendingPair).totalBorrow().toShares(_borrowAssetAmt, false), // note that assets are converted in shares
            _collateralAssetRemoveAmt,
            _podAmtMin,
            _pairedAssetAmtMin,
            _podSwapAmtOutMin,
            _userProvidedDebtAmtMax
        );
```

6. The borrower still has 2 shares of the asset left, but since he is trying to remove 100% of his collateral the function reverts 

Note that it's expected to revert as the borrower is trying to leave bad debt in the system with 2 borrowed shares and 0 collateral. The problem is not here, but in the first step of the close - `removeLeverage`.

### Impact

Note that this will happen often when borrowers try to repay 100% of their loans. Chains with higher block frequency like ARB, OP, BASE. POLY would experience this issue even more heavily where on these chains it would be nearly impossible to close such loan, due to the high likelihood of your repayment to be in another block, which would cause a minimal interest accrual.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of providing assets provide the amount of shares the borrower wants to close. Even better solution would be to make an exception where if the borrower called `removeLeverage` with `uint256.max` as `_borrowAssetAmt` to close his entire share balance.
