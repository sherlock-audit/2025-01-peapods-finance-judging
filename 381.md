# Wrong logic in `CamelotDexAdapter::swapV3Single` could grief the protocol through loss of funds

## Impact
### Summary 
The `CamelotDexAdapter::swapV3Single` function allows a user to swap some amounts of one token, say `tokenIn` in exchange for some amounts of another token, say `tokenOut`. However, a user can get some amounts of `tokenOut` without sending any amounts of `tokenIn` to the protocol. This results in a loss of funds for the protocol. 

### Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability lies in the fact that if a user specifies a value greater than zero for `tokenIn`, the said amount is transfered from the user to the protocol. However, when a user specifies zero as the amount of `tokenIn`, no amount of `tokenIn` is transfered from the user to the protocol whereas `tokenOut` is transfered to the user. 

This vulnerability can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L80-L107) or by taking a look at the code snippet below. 

```javascript
    function swapV3Single(
        address _tokenIn,
        address _tokenOut,
        uint24,
        uint256 _amountIn,
        uint256 _amountOutMin,
        address _recipient
    ) external override returns (uint256 _amountOut) {
        uint256 _outBefore = IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient);
        if (_amountIn == 0) {
90:            _amountIn = IERC20(_tokenIn).balanceOf(address(this));
        } else {
92:            IERC20(_tokenIn).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amountIn);
        }
        IERC20(_tokenIn).safeIncreaseAllowance(V3_ROUTER, _amountIn);
        ISwapRouterAlgebra(V3_ROUTER).exactInputSingle(
            ISwapRouterAlgebra.ExactInputSingleParams({
                tokenIn: _tokenIn,
                tokenOut: _tokenOut,
                recipient: _recipient,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _amountIn,
                amountOutMinimum: _amountOutMin,
                limitSqrtPrice: 0
            })
        );
        return IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient) - _outBefore;
    }
```


### Impact
A malicious user can drain the protocol of funds by specifying `_amountIn = 0` in the `CamelotDexAdapter::swapV3Single` function. From the computation on line 90 in the code snippet above, the protocol assumes the user has deposited `_tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this))`, calculates the equivalent amount of `_tokenOut` and sends to the user. 

## Proof of Concept

1. `userA` calls the `CamelotDexAdapter::swapV3Single` function while specifying `_amountIn` as `0`
2. `userA` gets some amount of `_tokenOut` corresponding to all the amount of `_tokenIn` in the protocol without sending any amount of `_tokenIn` into the protocol.


## Tools Used

Manual Review


## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Recommendation is to carry out the below two steps:
1. Remove the `else` statement so that line 92 in the code snippet above executes irrespective of the value passed in by the user for `_amountIn`.
2. modify line 90 in the code snippet above to `_amountIn = IERC20(_tokenIn).balanceOf(_msgSender());` to avoid reverts on line 92 when the user balance is less than the protocol balance. (This recommendation assumes that the protocol implies that a value of `_amountIn = 0` means the user intends to swap all the `_tokenIn` in their balance)

```diff
    function swapV3Single(
        address _tokenIn,
        address _tokenOut,
        uint24,
        uint256 _amountIn,
        uint256 _amountOutMin,
        address _recipient
    ) external override returns (uint256 _amountOut) {
        uint256 _outBefore = IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient);
        if (_amountIn == 0) {
-          _amountIn = IERC20(_tokenIn).balanceOf(address(this));
+          _amountIn = IERC20(_tokenIn).balanceOf(_msgSender());
+       }
-        } else {
-          IERC20(_tokenIn).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amountIn); 
-        }
+        IERC20(_tokenIn).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amountIn);
        IERC20(_tokenIn).safeIncreaseAllowance(V3_ROUTER, _amountIn);
        ISwapRouterAlgebra(V3_ROUTER).exactInputSingle(
            ISwapRouterAlgebra.ExactInputSingleParams({
                tokenIn: _tokenIn,
                tokenOut: _tokenOut,
                recipient: _recipient,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: _amountIn,
                amountOutMinimum: _amountOutMin,
                limitSqrtPrice: 0
            })
        );
        return IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient) - _outBefore;
    }

```
