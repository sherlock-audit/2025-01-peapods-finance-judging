# Insufficient Liquidity Validation in Position Management

### Summary

*Missing liquidity validation in `_removeCollateralAndRepay` will cause users' funds to be locked as malicious actors will drain lending pair liquidity before large withdrawals, preventing users from accessing their funds and potentially forcing them into liquidation.*

### Root Cause

*In `LeverageManager.sol:_removeCollateralAndRepay()` the function attempts withdrawals without checking available liquidity first:*

```solidity
function _removeCollateralAndRepay(
    uint256 _positionId,
    uint256 _collateralAssetRemoveAmt,
    uint256 _podAmtMin,
    uint256 _pairedAssetAmtMin
) internal returns (uint256 _podAmtReceived, uint256 _pairedAmtReceived) {
    // CRITICAL: No liquidity check before withdrawal
    uint256 _spTKNAmtReceived = IERC4626(_getAspTkn(_positionId))
        .redeem(_collateralAssetRemoveAmt, address(this), address(this));
    // ...
}
```

The function directly attempts to redeem tokens through the ERC4626 interface without first validating if the lending pair has sufficient liquidity to fulfill the withdrawal. This can lead to transaction failures and locked funds when liquidity is insufficient.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have a leveraged position with collateral amount greater than 0
2. Lending pair utilization needs to be at least 95%
3. User's withdrawal amount needs to be greater than available liquidity in the lending pair
4. Position must not be in liquidation state


### External Pre-conditions

1. Market conditions cause high utilization in lending pairs
2. No emergency withdrawal mechanism is active
3. Lending pair's available liquidity needs to be less than largest position's collateral


### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors for large positions in the protocol
2. When they identify a target, they borrow heavily from the lending pair to increase utilization
3. When the target tries to withdraw their collateral, the transaction reverts due to insufficient liquidity
4. Target's funds remain locked until liquidity returns to the pool


### Impact

*Users cannot withdraw their collateral when there is insufficient liquidity in the lending pair. For example, if a user has 100 ETH collateral but the lending pair only has 50 ETH in liquidity, their withdrawal will fail and their funds will be locked until more liquidity becomes available. This can lead to forced liquidations if users can't withdraw to adjust their positions during market volatility.*

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Implement a liquidity check function that verifies the lending pair has sufficient liquidity before attempting withdrawal
