# Missing reward claim mechanism in LeverageManager for leveraged positions owners

### Summary
The LeverageManager contract lacks functionality to claim and distribute staking rewards earned by leveraged positions. During the staking, the `IndexUtils.sol` uses  `_msgSender()` as the `_user` shows that the receiver of the POOL_REWARDS will be `leverageManager` contract, during the remove leverage post callback, the index utils [transfer from](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/IndexUtils.sol#L115) the leverage contract the asp token
```solidity
IERC20(_spTKN).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(indexUtils), _spTKNAmtReceived);
```
this trigers the _update of the lp staking pool and reset the shares of the leverageManager contract
```solidity
function _update(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) internal override {
        super._update(_from, _to, _value);
        if (_from != address(0)) {
->>         TokenRewards(POOL_REWARDS).setShares(_from, _value, true);
        }
        if (_to != address(0) && _to != address(0xdead)) {
            TokenRewards(POOL_REWARDS).setShares(_to, _value, false);
        }
    }
```
this causes the distribution of rewards of leverageManager address and distributed, this rewards belong to the leverage creator.

### Root Cause
During the staking process through IndexUtils.sol, the LeverageManager becomes the msg.sender and therefore the receiver of staking rewards:
```solidity
function _stakeLPForUserHandlingLeftoverCheck(address _stakingPool, address _receiver, uint256 _stakeAmount)
    internal
    returns (uint256 _finalAmountOut)
{
    if (IERC20(_stakingPool).balanceOf(address(this)) > 0) {
        IStakingPoolToken(_stakingPool).stake(_receiver, _stakeAmount);
        return _finalAmountOut;
    }
    // LeverageManager becomes the staker
    IStakingPoolToken(_stakingPool).stake(address(this), _stakeAmount);
}
```
When rewards are distributed in TokenRewards.sol, they are sent directly to the staker (LeverageManager):
```solidity
    function _distributeReward(address _wallet) internal {
        if (shares[_wallet] == 0) {
            return;
        }
        for (uint256 _i; _i < _allRewardsTokens.length; _i++) {
            address _token = _allRewardsTokens[_i];

            if (REWARDS_WHITELISTER.paused(_token)) {
                continue;
            }

            uint256 _amount = getUnpaid(_token, _wallet);
            rewards[_token][_wallet].realized += _amount;
            rewards[_token][_wallet].excluded = _cumulativeRewards(_token, shares[_wallet], true);
            if (_amount > 0) {
                rewardsDistributed[_token] += _amount;
                IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_wallet, _amount);
                emit DistributeReward(_wallet, _token, _amount);
            }
        }
    }
```
The LeverageManager contract has no functionality to:

- Track rewards per position
- Allow position owners to claim their rewards
- Forward rewards to the correct recipients
When the `_d.token` is a reward token, [it will be transferred to the next leverage position owner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L339-L342):
```solidity
// pay back flash loan and send remaining to borrower
        IERC20(_d.token).safeTransfer(IFlashLoanSource(_getFlashSource(_props.positionId)).source(), _flashPaybackAmt);
        uint256 _remaining = IERC20(_d.token).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (_remaining != 0) {
            IERC20(_d.token).safeTransfer(positionNFT.ownerOf(_props.positionId), _remaining);
        }
```
After unstaking and removing lp, and rewards are been directly distributed to the leverageManager, [it expects the repay amount to always be less than the paired amount received](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L383), but when the reward distribution includes borrowed token, the paired amount received will be inflated potentially causing DOS.
### Impact
Users with leveraged positions rewards are not track, causing a loss to leverage positions owners

### Mitigation
Add reward tracking and claiming functionality to LeverageManager
