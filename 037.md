# `PodUnwrapLocker` can be drained due to an arbitrary input

### Summary

`PodUnwrapLocker` can be drained due to an arbitrary input

### Root Cause

`PodUnwrapLocker` provides a functionality to debond your pod tokens without paying a fee by locking them for a period of time. The issue is that the function allows an arbitrary pod input which allows for a complete drain of the contract:
```solidity
function debondAndLock(address _pod, uint256 _amount) external nonReentrant {
       // NO CHECK FOR THE POD HERE
}
```

### Attack Path

1. A malicious contract is provided as the pod upon calling `debondAndLock()`
2. In the line below, pod returns an array of 2 addresses which are both the same token, token `X` (token to be drained, deposited by other users who are using the contract functionality):
```solidity
IDecentralizedIndex.IndexAssetInfo[] memory _podTokens = _podContract.getAllAssets();
```
3. In the line below, we store the token `X` balances in both of the array fields, let's say 100 tokens:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
            _tokens[i] = _podTokens[i].token;
            _balancesBefore[i] = IERC20(_tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
        }
```
4. We then call `debond()` on our contract which transfers in 100 tokens of `X`
5. In the line below, we fill the received amounts array with 100 tokens twice:
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
            _receivedAmounts[i] = IERC20(_tokens[i]).balanceOf(address(this)) - _balancesBefore[i];
        }
```
6. We return our own config with a 0 duration to immediately withdraw and store our received amounts in the locks mapping
7. We go over our token `X` twice with 100 amount in both fields, receiving 200 tokens even though we put in 100

### Impact

Theft of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not allow arbitrary pods
