# `_minPtknOut` value is completely incorrect due to wrong implementation

### Summary

`_minPtknOut` value is completely incorrect due to wrong implementation

### Root Cause

Upon the reward processing flow in `AutoCompoundingPodLp`, we have the following code to compute the minimum pod tokens:
```solidity
if (address(podOracle) != address(0)) {
            _minPtknOut = (podOracle.getPodPerBasePrice() * _pairedSwapAmt * 10 ** IERC20Metadata(address(pod)).decimals() * 95) / 10 ** IERC20Metadata(_pairedLpToken).decimals() / 10 ** 18 / 100;
        }
```
The flow of `getPodPerBasePrice()` is completely incorrect and makes no sense. We call this function:
```solidity
    function getPodPerBasePrice() external view override returns (uint256 _pricePTknPerBase18) {
        _pricePTknPerBase18 = 10 ** (18 * 2) / _calculateBasePerPTkn(0);
    }
```
We get the base per `pTKN` and we inverse it to get the `pTKN` per base. This means that `_calculateBasePerPTkn()` should return the amount of base tokens per each `pTKN` for this to be correct. There, we have the following code:
```solidity
(_isBadData, _price18) = _getDefaultPrice18();
```
It gets the underlying token's USD price in 18 decimals:
```solidity
(UNISWAP_V3_SINGLE_PRICE_ORACLE).getPriceUSD18(BASE_CONVERSION_CHAINLINK_FEED, underlyingTkn, UNDERLYING_TKN_CL_POOL, twapInterval);
```
Then, that same value is used like this during the `_accountForCBRInPrice()` flow:
```solidity
uint256 _pTknAmt = (_amtUnderlying * 10 ** IERC20Metadata(_pod).decimals()) / 10 ** IERC20Metadata(_underlying).decimals();
return IDecentralizedIndex(_pod).convertToAssets(_pTknAmt);
```
The underlying token USD price is used to convert from the underlying pod token to the asset of the pod. Then, this is the value returned (ignoring the debond fee for simplicity) from `__calculateBasePerPTkn()`. This is clearly incorrect as this does not return the amount of base tokens per each `pTKN` as the input to `convertToassets()` is not a single `pTKN` but an amount of tokens dependent on its underlying token USD value. This means that the inversion will then be completely incorrect and thus the `_minPtknOut` value will either be super big or super small depending on the USD value.

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

No attack path, explained in `Root Cause`

### Impact

Either a revert due to an unrealistic min amount out or a theft of funds due to very high slippage provided.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Refactor the flow fully, it is completely incorrect and makes no sense
