# Liquidations will revert incorrectly due to an out-of-sync leftover collateral value

### Summary

Liquidations will revert incorrectly due to an out-of-sync value

### Root Cause

Upon liquidations, we have this code:
```solidity
_leftoverCollateral = (_userCollateralBalance.toInt256() - _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator.toInt256());

_collateralForLiquidator = _leftoverCollateral <= 0 ? _userCollateralBalance : (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + dirtyLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;
```
We compute an optimistic collateral for the liquidator which is based on `cleanLiquidationFee`. If the leftover collateral is not below 0, we recompute the collateral for liquidator based on the `dirtyLiquidationFee` which is a value lower than the clean fee (if we take a look at [Fraxlend](https://etherscan.io/address/0x78bb3aec3d855431bd9289fd98da13f9ebb7ef15#code), it is 9000 vs 10000 for the clean fee).

Then, we have this code:
```solidity
if (_leftoverCollateral <= 0) {
                ...
} else if (_leftoverCollateral < minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation.toInt256()) {
       revert BadDirtyLiquidation();
}
```
If the leftover collateral is <=, we end up in the first block where we compute shares to adjust. If it is above 0 however, we will revert if we are under `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation`. The issue is that the leftover collateral is still based on the optimistic calculation which results in a much lower leftover collateral, resulting in reverts when the actual leftover collateral is not even close to `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation`.

### Attack Path

1. Let's imagine the following state:
- userCollateralBalance = 2.3e18
- dirtyLiquidationFee = 9_000 (based on Fraxlend)
- cleanLiquidationFee = 10_000 (based on Fraxlend)
- `_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits` is equal to 2e18 based on the shares to liquidate provided by the user
- `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation` is 1.1e17
2. `_optimisticCollateralForLiquidator` will equal `2e18 * (1e5 + 1e4) / 1e5 = 2.2e18`
3. `_leftoverCollateral` equals `2.3e18 - 2.2e18 = 1e17`
4. As it is above 0, we recompute the collateral for liquidator which will equal `2e18 * (1e5 + 9e3) / 1e5 = 2.18e18`
5. As the leftover collateral is 1e17 and the minimum required collateral is 1.1e17, we will revert
6. In reality, the actual leftover collateral is `2.3e18 - 2.18e18 = 1.2e17` as the collateral we will take out from the user is 2.18e18, not 2.2e18

### Impact

Liquidations will revert incorrectly which is an extremely time-sensitive operation, this can lead to bad debt for the protocol

### Mitigation

Update the leftover collateral based on the new collateral for the liquidator
