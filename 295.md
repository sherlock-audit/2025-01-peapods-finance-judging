# repayment amount is supposed to be sent back to DecentralisedIndex.sol  and not flash source (reverts)

### Summary

`LeverageManager._removeLeveragePostCallback()` erroneously sends back _repayAmount to Flash Source instead of DecentralisedIndex.sol, this will cause reverts. 

### Root Cause

LeverageManager.removeLeverage() uses flash source contracts to get flashloans to remove leverage.

There's an issue in the logic of its callback function when repaying the borrowed amount. The borrowed amount is erroneously sent to flash source  in `_removeLeveragePostCallback()` instead of DecentralisedIndex.sol https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L399

This will cause reverts here in  DecentralisedIndex.sol- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L416

Also most flash source don't have methods to remove or send the received funds from the leverage Manager to DecentralisedIndex.sol

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. repay funds is sent to flash source instead of DecentralisedIndex.sol
2. flash source doesn't send the received funds back to DecentralisedIndex.sol

### External Pre-conditions

not needed.

### Attack Path

Natural occurring bug.

### Impact

LeverageManager.removeLeverage() will likely always revert due to reverts in DecentralisedIndex.sol caused by not repaying borrowed amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

return the repay amount to DecentralisedIndex.sol
