# No minimum amount provided when zapping and bonding OHM tokens

### Summary

No minimum amount provided when zapping and bonding OHM tokens

### Root Cause

Upon using the zap functionality to deposit into the `pOHM` pod, we have the following code:
```solidity
uint256 _pOHMBefore = IERC20(pOHM).balanceOf(address(this));
        IERC20(OHM).safeIncreaseAllowance(pOHM, _amountOut);
        IDecentralizedIndex(pOHM).bond(OHM, _amountOut, 0);
        return IERC20(pOHM).balanceOf(address(this)) - _pOHMBefore;
```
As seen, upon bonding the OHM tokens to `pOHM`, we provide a 0 as the minimum amount to mint.

NOTE: The README states that they have decided to not put slippage in many places of swaps as the swap amounts will be small. This is different as the user can provide a ton of tokens and it is bonding, not swapping.
### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User uses the zap functionality and wants to bond to `pOHM`
2. He expects getting 100 `pOHM` however due to a frontrun or market conditions, he receives 50
3. As the user can not provide a minimum amount, he can not guard against that

### Impact

Users will receive less than expected

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Let users provide a minimum amount
