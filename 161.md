# ChainlinkOracle can return prices outside acceptable range due to circuit breaker using deprecated parameters

### Summary

The [`ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle.sol:112`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle.sol#L112) implements a circuit breaker mechanism by validating the data feed answer against parameters that are no longer used. This validation has no effect in most cases and does not prevent the protocol from reading an answer outside the acceptable range.

### Root Cause

The `ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle` validates the data feed answer against the aggregator's `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` parameters. According to Chainlink [documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits), these values are no longer used in most data feeds and do not prevent applications from reading the most recent answer. Almost all data feeds return `1` for `minAnswer` and `type(uint256).max` for `maxAnswer`, making this validation have no effect.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

An incorrect price is provided by the data feed, or extreme price volatility occurs, causing the price to exceed acceptable limit.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The circuit breaker mechanism does not function as intended, potentially leading to incorrect price assumptions.

### PoC

Sherlock [rules](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#viii.-list-of-issue-categories-that-are-considered-valid) stand that for this type of issue to be valid, explicitly mentioning the price feeds for the in-scope tokens on the in-scope chains is required. Any token can be used as the underlying token for a pod, so essentially almost any price feed could serve as an example. However, let's examine a specific case with cbBTC on the Base chain:

1. Initiate the pod creation process.
2. Add cbBTC as the underlying token.
3. Select an oracle type to use for the LVF â€” choose Chainlink Price Feed.
4. Two price feeds against USDC need to be provided: cbBTC/USD and USDC/USD.

5. Both price feeds do not use the `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` parameters.

### Mitigation

Follow Chainlink documentation and, on the contract side, implement the ability to pause the oracle when the price exceeds limits deemed acceptable by the protocol. Additionally, consider creating off-chain monitoring to respond when potential issues occur.
