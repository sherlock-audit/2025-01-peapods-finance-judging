# Price Validation Enables Unfair Liquidations

### Summary

*Inconsistent price deviation validation in `_updateExchangeRate` will cause unfair liquidations for borrowers as malicious liquidators will execute liquidations during periods of price uncertainty while borrowers are prevented from taking defensive actions.*

### Root Cause

*In `FraxlendPairCore.sol:_updateExchangeRate()` the price deviation check (`_isBorrowAllowed`) is only enforced for borrowing operations while being ignored for other critical functions like liquidations, deposits, and withdrawals.*
```solidity
function _updateExchangeRate() internal returns (
    bool _isBorrowAllowed,  // Only used for borrow operations
    uint256 _lowExchangeRate,
    uint256 _highExchangeRate
) {
    // ... price fetching logic ...
    
    uint256 _deviation = (_highExchangeRate - _lowExchangeRate) * DEVIATION_PRECISION / _highExchangeRate;
    _isBorrowAllowed = _deviation <= maxOracleDeviation;
    
    return (_isBorrowAllowed, _lowExchangeRate, _highExchangeRate);
}

// In liquidate() - No price validation
function liquidate(address _borrower, uint256 _amount) external {
    (, uint256 _exchangeRate,) = _updateExchangeRate();  // Ignores _isBorrowAllowed
    if (_isSolvent(_borrower, _exchangeRate)) {
        revert BorrowerSolvent();
    }
    // ... liquidation logic ...
}
```
The issue is compounded by the LTV calculation which is sensitive to price fluctuations:
```solidity
uint256 _ltv = (((_borrowerAmount * _exchangeRate) / EXCHANGE_PRECISION) * LTV_PRECISION) / _collateralAmount;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Price deviation between Chainlink and UniV3 TWAP needs to be greater than `maxOracleDeviation`
2. Borrower position needs to be close to liquidation threshold

### External Pre-conditions

1. One of the oracles (either Chainlink or UniV3 TWAP) reports an incorrect or manipulated price, causing the deviation
2. The true market price could be anywhere between the two oracle prices or even outside their range
3. UniV3 pool needs to have sufficient liquidity for TWAP calculation
4. Market conditions or oracle manipulation cause sustained price deviation above `maxOracleDeviation`

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors for high price deviation between oracles
2. When deviation exceeds `maxOracleDeviation`, borrowing becomes restricted
3. Attacker identifies borrower positions near the liquidation threshold
4. Attacker executes liquidation using potentially unsafe prices
5. Borrower cannot defend position due to borrowing restrictions

### Impact

*The borrowers suffer unfair liquidations during price uncertainty periods. The attackers gain liquidation rewards while borrowers lose their collateral at potentially unfair prices. Additionally, the protocol's security is compromised as the system can become undercollateralized through unsafe withdrawals.*

### Mitigation

1. Implement consistent price validation across all critical operations using a new modifier:
```solidity
modifier requireValidPrices() {
    (bool _valid,,) = _updateExchangeRate();
    require(_valid, "Price deviation too high");
    _;
}
```
