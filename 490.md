# No usable DexAdapter on Berachain.


### Summary

No usable DexAdapter on Berachain.

### Root Cause

From the contest README, we know the project is going to be deployed on Berachain.

> Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
> 
> Ethereum, Arbitrum One, Base, Mode, Berachain

However, none of the DexAdapters currently supports it.

- [AerodromeDexAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/AerodromeDexAdapter.sol)
- [CamelotDexAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol)
- [UniswapDexAdapter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/UniswapDexAdapter.sol)

The current use case is: Uniswap on Ethereum, Aerodrome on Base, Camelot on Arbitrum, Kim (which also uses Uniswap DexAdapter) on Mode.

On Berachain, the native Dex is [BEX](https://docs.bex.berachain.com/learn/), which is a BalancerV2 fork. Currently the adapters only support forks of Uniswap V2/V3, so it can't work with BEX.

There is another [Kodiac](https://documentation.kodiak.finance/), which is a Uniswap V2/V3 fork. However, the current code still can't directly integrate with it.

From Kodiac [docs](https://documentation.kodiak.finance/overview/kodiak-contracts) and [InitCodeHash.sol](https://beratrail.io/address/0xFE5E8C83FFE4d9627A75EaA7Fee864768dB989bD/contract/80094/code), we can see the initCodeHash is different from the current `TwapUtilities` provides. This bricks all `getV3Pool()` calls within Peapods, which uses the initCodeHash to [compute pool address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/twaputils/V3TwapUtilities.sol#L26). This function is used in multiple places, e.g. TokenRewards swap in [`depositFromPairedLpToken()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L167-L171).

```solidity
library InitCode {
    ...
@>  bytes32 internal constant V3_INIT_CODE_HASH = 0xd8e2091bc519b509176fc39aeb148cc8444418d3ce260820edc44e806c2c2339;
}
```
