# Voting Power Loss on Additional Stake

### Summary

Voting Power Loss on Additional Stake in the `_updateUserState` function where *users lose* voting power when adding more stake after a conversion rate decrease. The function incorrectly applies new conversion rates to the entire staked amount instead of only the new stake, causing users to lose the voting power they should have maintained from their original stake.

### Root Cause

In `VotingPool.sol:_updateUserState()` the function incorrectly overwrites the entire stake's conversion factor with the new rate instead of preserving original rates for existing stake:

```solidity
function _updateUserState(address _user, address _asset, uint256 _addAmt) internal {
    Stake storage _stake = stakes[_user][_asset];
    
    // Calculate old amount (correct)
    uint256 _mintedAmtBefore = (_stake.amtStaked * _stake.stakedToOutputFactor) / _den;
    
    // Add new amount
    _stake.amtStaked += _addAmt;
    
    // CRITICAL FLAW: Updates rates for entire amount
    _stake.stakedToOutputFactor = _convFctr;
    _stake.stakedToOutputDenomenator = _convDenom;
    
    // CRITICAL FLAW: Applies new rate to total amount
    uint256 _finalNewMintAmt = (_stake.amtStaked * _convFctr) / _convDenom;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set initial `stakedToOutputFactor` to be at least 2x
2. Users need to stake tokens when the factor is high
3. Admin needs to decrease `stakedToOutputFactor` to be at most 1x
4. Users need to have a significant stake (>1000 tokens) under the old rate

### External Pre-conditions

no external pre-conditions 

### Attack Path

2. Admin reduces conversion rate to 1x
3. When users try to add more stake, their entire stake (old + new) gets converted at 1x
4. Users lose voting power from their original stake

### Impact

Users who add more stakes after a rate decrease will lose voting power over their original stake. For example, suppose the total voting power ba user has 1000 tokens staked at 2x rate (2000 voting power) and adds 500 more tokens after the rate changes to 1x. In that case, it comes to 1500 instead of the expected 2500, resulting in a loss of 500 voting power from their original stake. this could be a design choice but the gap between the first and the second stake makes the user keep the first stake to avoid losing which is against the protocol that needs more stake.

### PoC

```solidity
Example Scenario:
Initial Stake:
- Amount: 1000 tokens
- Rate: 2x
- Voting Power: 2000

After Rate Change (1x) and Adding 500 tokens:
Current Implementation:
- Total Stake: 1500 tokens
- New Power: 1500 (LOSS of 500 power!)

Should Be:
- Original: 2000 power (1000 * 2x)
- New Stake: 500 power (500 * 1x)
- Total: 2500 power
```

### Mitigation

Implement stake segmentation to track different stakes separately.
