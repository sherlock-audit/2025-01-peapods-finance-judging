# Dangerous use of deadline parameter

## Description

The protocol is using `block.timestamp` as the `deadline` argument while interacting with the Uniswap which completely defeats the purpose of using a deadline.

## Summary

[swapV3Single](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L80),  [_swapV3Multi](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Zapper.sol#L182), [swapV2SingleExactOut](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L55) and  [swapV2Single](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L32C14-L32C26) are protected by a deadline parameter to limit the execution of pending transactions. Using `block.timestamp` as the `deadline` is effectively a no-operation that has no effect nor protection. Since `block.timestamp` will take the timestamp value when the transaction gets mined, the check will end up comparing `block.timestamp` against the same value, i.e. `block.timestamp <= block.timestamp` 
```solidity
modifier checkDeadline(uint256 deadline) {
        require(_blockTimestamp() <= deadline, 'Transaction too old');
        _;
    }
```

```solidity
 modifier ensure(uint deadline) {
        require(deadline >= block.timestamp, 'UniswapV2Router: EXPIRED');
        _;
    }
```


## Impact
Swap can be maliciously executed later, user can face up with the loss when the value of token change. In the worst scenario, vault can be liquidated because of the swap.


## Recommendation
User should be able to set the deadline.
