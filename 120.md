# Flash Loan Vulnerability

Vulnerability Existence
The code contains risks of flash loan attacks, primarily centered around the reward distribution logic in the _processRewardsToPodLp function. This function calculates the reward amount available for conversion based on the real-time account balance, but fails to protect the following critical aspects:

Balance Snapshot Attack:
Within the loop of the _processRewardsToPodLp() function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L213

<SOLIDITY>
uint256 _bal = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (...);
Directly reads the current balance without time weighting or snapshot freezing, allowing attackers to temporarily manipulate the balance within a single transaction through flash loans.

Missing Slippage Control:

When _twoHops=true, in the second hop transaction (_path[1]->path[2]) of _swapV2(), the _amountOutMin parameter is not enforced, allowing zero slippage protection:
<SOLIDITY>
DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_path[1], _path[2], _intermediateBal, 0, address(this)); // the last parameter is _amountOutMin
Attack Path Simulation
An attacker can execute a flash loan attack through the following steps:

Borrow a large amount of _asset() tokens through a flash loan
Call deposit() -> triggers _processRewardsToPodLp() reward distribution
Utilize the temporarily high balance caused by the flash loan to accelerate reward calculation
Arbitrage through the transaction path without slippage protection during the reward conversion process
Repay the flash loan and retain the inflated rewards
Fix Recommendations
Introduce a balance snapshot mechanism:

<SOLIDITY>
// Record initial balance before reward processing
uint256 initialBal = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 _bal = initialBal - (...);
(Referencing the balance differential verification mode in DODO Margin Trading)

Enforce minimum slippage control:
Add hard slippage parameter verification in all transaction paths of _swapV2():

<SOLIDITY>
require(_amountOut >= _amountOutMin, "Slippage limit exceeded");
