# Incorrect reserve mapping leads to fault swap

### Summary

The function `_getSwapAmt` incorrectly assumes that `_r0` corresponds to `_t0` and `_r1` corresponds to `_t1`. However, Uniswap V2's `getReserves()` returns reserves based on the **sorted** order of token addresses, not based on input order. This mismatch leads to **incorrect swap calculations**, resulting in potential losses and arbitrage opportunities for attackers.

### Root Cause

- The function retrieves reserves via:
  ```solidity
  (uint112 _r0, uint112 _r1) = DEX_ADAPTER.getReserves(DEX_ADAPTER.getV2Pool(_t0, _t1));
  ```
- `UniswapDexAdapter` contract:

  ```solidity
  function getReserves(address _pool) external view virtual override returns (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) {
        (_reserve0, _reserve1,) = IUniswapV2Pair(_pool).getReserves();
    }
  ```

- It assumes `_r0` belongs to `_t0` and `_r1` belongs to `_t1`.
- V2 reserves are always returned in **ascending order of token addresses**.
- If `_t0 > _t1`, `_r0` will belong to `_t1`, and `_r1` will belong to `_t0`, breaking the swap calculation.

### Internal Pre-conditions


### External Pre-conditions


### Attack Path


### Impact

The amount of `_pairedLpToken` that needs to be swapped may be miscalculated, causing the swap to fail.
Even if the swap succeeds, it does not work as intended by the protocol, which breaks the design of V2Pool and the `AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
    function _getSwapAmt(address _t0, address _t1, address _swapT, uint256 _fullAmt) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint112 _r0, uint112 _r1) = DEX_ADAPTER.getReserves(DEX_ADAPTER.getV2Pool(_t0, _t1));
+++     (address token0,) = sortTokens(_t0, _t1);
+++     (_r0, _r1) = _t0 == token0 ? (_r0, _r1) : (_r1, _r0);
        uint112 _r = _swapT == _t0 ? _r0 : _r1;
        return (_sqrt(_r * (_fullAmt * 3988000 + _r * 3988009)) - (_r * 1997)) / 1994;
    }
```
