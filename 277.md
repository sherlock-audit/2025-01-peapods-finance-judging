# createSelfLendingPodAndAddLvf() fails - aspTKNMinimumOracle cannot initialize with a non-existent Fraxlend pair

### Summary

A logic error in `createSelfLendingPodAndAddLvf()` causes an initialization failure for `aspTKNMinimumOracle` for self-lending pods.  The function attempts to initialize the oracle with the Fraxlend pair address before the pair itself is created, leading to incorrect initialization parameters and ultimately preventing the creation of self-lending pods. This will halt LVF operations for this specific pod type.

### Root Cause

The `createSelfLendingPodAndAddLvf()` function ([LeverageFactory.sol#L90C14-L90C43](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageFactory.sol#L90C14-L90C43)) aims to create an `aspTknOracle`, a Fraxlend pair, a lending pod, and the `aspTkn` in that order.  
However, this sequence is flawed. The `aspTknOracle` (which inherits from `spTknOracle`) requires the address of the Fraxlend pair as the `BASE_TOKEN` during its construction ([spTKNMinimalOracle.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol)).  Since the Fraxlend pair is created *after* the oracle, the oracle's constructor receives an incorrect address.

While the `spTkn` (quote token) can be set to `address(0)` initially and updated later via `setSpTknAndDependencies()` ([spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L264](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L264)), the `BASE_TOKEN` is required in the `spTknOracle` constructor and cannot be updated later. 
 The `BASE_TOKEN` is a Fraxlend pair in the case of  a self lending pod. As the `spTkn` is composed of the `pTkn` and the `fTKN`. This `fTKN` will be created just after the oracle and then used it as the `pairedLpAsset` of the pod.

The test case [`test_createSelfLendingPodAndAddLvf()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/test/lvf/LeverageFactory.t.sol#L230) exacerbates this issue by passing `dai` instead of the Fraxlend pair address for `_aspTknOracleRequiredImmutables` **AND**  by putting `BASE_IS_FRAX_PAIR` to false, masking the problem during testing. 
It's not an aspTKNMinimalOracle with correct settings, as it will **never taking** account that the pairedLPAsset is a fraxlend pair. It doesn't follow the [aspTKNOracle documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-T_07QpJlqXlbBSiC_YverKFfu-gcSkOBzU1icMRkM/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.ss4sq0h3zsu7).

Based on the comment of  [`BASE_TOKEN`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L16C5-L17C51)
>/// @dev The base token we will price against in the oracle. Will be either pairedLpAsset
>/// @dev or the borrow token in a lending pair

So an oralce for a  self lending pod, you **NEED** to put the fraxlend pair (that is the pairedLpAsset) as the `BASE_TOKEN` and then you retrieve the borrow token in a lending pair through : 
```Solidity
 address _baseInCl = BASE_TOKEN;
        if (BASE_IS_POD) {
            IDecentralizedIndex.IndexAssetInfo[] memory _baseAssets = IDecentralizedIndex(BASE_TOKEN).getAllAssets();
            _baseInCl = _baseAssets[0].token;
        } else if (BASE_IS_FRAX_PAIR) {
            _baseInCl = IFraxlendPair(BASE_TOKEN).asset();
        }
        BASE_IN_CL = _baseInCl;
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `createSelfLendingPodAndAddLvf()` is called with the intention of creating a self-lending pod (`BASE_IS_FRAX_PAIR` is true).

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `createSelfLendingPodAndAddLvf()` to create a self-lending pod.
2. The function attempts to initialize `aspTknOracle` with an incorrect `BASE_TOKEN` address (either `dai` like the test case or a default value).
3. The oracle initialization fails immediately

### Impact

The protocol will be unable to create self-lending pods, halting LVF operations for this specific pod type. This is a critical functional regression that severely impacts the protocol's upgradeability and the overall utility of the new LVF mechanism. Users intending to leverage assets via self-lending pods will be completely blocked.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Introduce a setter function similar to `setSpTknAndDependencies()` to allow setting the `BASE_TOKEN` and  `BASE_IN_CL` after the Fraxlend pair is created.  This setter should be called at the end of `createSelfLendingPodAndAddLvf()` after the Fraxlend pair has been successfully deployed. This will ensure the oracle is initialized with the correct address, enabling proper functionality for self-lending pods.
