# Attacker can conduct a vault inflation attack in `WeightedIndex` by abusing the flash minting functionality

### Summary

Attacker can conduct a vault inflation attack in `WeightedIndex` by abusing the flash minting functionality

### Root Cause

An attacker can abuse the `DecentralizedIndex::flashMint()` function to conduct a vault inflation attack, resulting in a theft of funds from the second depositor.

```solidity
function flashMint(address _recipient, uint256 _amount, bytes calldata _data) external override lock {
        _shortCircuitRewards = 1;
        uint256 _fee = _amount / 1000;
        _mint(_recipient, _amount);
        IFlashLoanRecipient(_recipient).callback(_data);
        _burn(_recipient, _amount);
        _totalSupply -= _fee == 0 ? 1 : _fee;
        _burn(_msgSender(), _fee == 0 ? 1 : _fee);
        _shortCircuitRewards = 0;
}
```
The attacker can provide such an amount to flashmint, such that the total supply goes to 1 which causes the share value to be inflated, one share will equal 100% of the assets in the pod. Then, the next depositor can be minted 0 shares, leading to the theft of funds of his assets.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. No deposits in the pod

### External Pre-conditions

__No external conditions__

### Attack Path

NOTE: After some inspections, there is a minimum amount to mint so the issue with the steps below is not possible if the user provides a minimum of more than 0. To not change the issue a lot and spend another hour writing it, I will be leaving the path for the usual vault inflation attack below, but I will have a second part after step 5, where I am explaining how the issue can take place without any type of user error (as providing 0 minimum can be considered a user error):
1. Victim deposits 1e18 in an empty pod, we will assume the pod is made of only 1 token for simplicity purposes, also ignoring bond and debond fees
2. Attacker frontruns by depositing `1e18 + 1` assets which mints him 1e18 + 1 shares
3. In a batch with the above step, attacker flashmints 1000000000000000000000 shares, which results in a fee of `1000000000000000000000 / 1000 = 1e18`, the total supply is decreased by the fee, thus `(1e18 + 1) - 1e18 = 1`, total supply is now 1 and the total assets of the underlying token in the pod is `1e18 + 1`
4. When the victim's deposit goes through, we will have the following calculations:
- 1e18 * 2^96 / (1e18 + 1) = 79228162514264337514315787821 (`tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96`)
- tokens minted will be `1 * 79228162514264337514315787821 / (2^96) = 0` due to a round down
- transfer amount will be `(1e18 + 1) * 79228162514264337514315787821 / (2^96) = 999999999999999999`
- now the total supply is still 1 but the total assets are 2e18
5. Attacker redeems his share for a profit, stealing all of the funds from the victim

As explained earlier, the attack path above can be avoided by the user providing a minimum amount of pod tokens to mint. However, the scenario can occur in a particular case where we are in a `pOHM` pod. If a user calls `IndexUtils::addLPAndStake()` where he wants to provide liquidity using the `pOHM` pod and wants to use the zap functionality, eventually we will reach this code in `_zap()`:
```solidity
 IDecentralizedIndex(pOHM).bond(OHM, _amountOut, 0);
```
This flow provides no minimum, thus let's assume that we get minted 0 shares due to the issue explained in the attack path. Then, we have this code:
```solidity
_amountOut = _indexFund.addLiquidityV2(
            IERC20(_indexFundAddy).balanceOf(address(this)) - (_idxTokensBefore == 0 ? 1 : _idxTokensBefore),
            IERC20(_pairedLpToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - (_pairedLpTokenBefore == 0 ? 1 : _pairedLpTokenBefore),
            _slippage,
            _deadline
        );
```
When the attacker did the frontrun, he should also send 1 `pOHM` token so we do not do an underflow, that way the input would be `1 - 0 = 1` instead of `0 - 1 -> underflow`. Then, we reach this code where we add the liquidity:
```solidity
        DEX_HANDLER.addLiquidity(
            address(this),
            PAIRED_LP_TOKEN,
            _pTKNLPTokens,
            _pairedLPTokens,
            (_pTKNLPTokens * (1000 - _slippage)) / 1000,
            (_pairedLPTokens * (1000 - _slippage)) / 1000,
            _msgSender(),
            _deadline
        );
```
For the `pTKN`, the minimum amount would be based on the user data while for the paired LP token (the `pOHM`), the input would be 0 (unless no slippage) as we are multiplying a number less than 1000 by 1 and then dividing it by 1000, this rounds to 0. We eventually reach this code in the V2 router:
```solidity
if (reserveA == 0 && reserveB == 0) {
            (amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBDesired);
        } else {
            uint256 amountBOptimal = UniswapV2Library.quote(amountADesired, reserveA, reserveB);
            if (amountBOptimal <= amountBDesired) {
                require(amountBOptimal >= amountBMin, "UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_B_AMOUNT");
                (amountA, amountB) = (amountADesired, amountBOptimal);
            } else {
                uint256 amountAOptimal = UniswapV2Library.quote(amountBDesired, reserveB, reserveA);
                assert(amountAOptimal <= amountADesired);
                require(amountAOptimal >= amountAMin, "UniswapV2Router: INSUFFICIENT_A_AMOUNT");
                (amountA, amountB) = (amountAOptimal, amountBDesired);
            }
        }
```
Here, for simplicity, we can assume that there is no liquidity (which is a completely valid case), thus we will just use the provided `X` `pTKN` tokens and 1 `pOHM`. Then, we mint the liquidity. In the end, the user gets minted liquidity for providing `X` `pTKN` and 1 `pOHM` when he actually provided `X` `pTKN` and `Y` amount of the `pOHM` which was stolen due to the vault inflation and the fact that no slippage was provided during the zap `pOHM` bond.

### Impact

Direct theft of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Mint dead shares or refactor the flash minting functionality to charge the fee in a different way, which does not allow the share value to go up like explained in the issue.
