# Potential Loss of Funds Due to Incorrect `_processBurnFee()` Handling

 The [_processBurnFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L217-L224) function is designed to burn a portion of transferred tokens based on the burn fee:
```solidity
    function _processBurnFee(uint256 _amtToProcess) internal {
        if (_amtToProcess == 0 || _fees.burn == 0) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 _burnAmt = (_amtToProcess * _fees.burn) / DEN;
        _totalSupply -= _burnAmt;
        _burn(address(this), _burnAmt);
    }
```  
The standard ERC20 `_burn` function already decreases the total supply when burning tokens. By manually decreasing `_totalSupply` before calling `_burn`, this implementation is double-counting the burn amount. The double deduction means the actual total supply will be less than it should be
This could cause significant issues with:
- Price calculations that depend on total supply
- Liquidity provisioning that uses total supply in calculations
- Any external integrations that rely on accurate total supply data

## Impact
Double accounting of burned tokens can lead to an incorrect supply representation, affecting pricing mechanisms and integrations that rely on total supply data.  

## Mitigation 
Simply remove the `_totalSupply -= _burnAmt;` line since the inherited `_burn` function already handles the supply accounting correctly.
