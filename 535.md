# Some pod token transfers can be reverted unexpectedly

### Summary

Some pod token transfers can be reverted unexpectedly

### Root Cause

In decentralized index contract, we have a little bit complex transfer functionality. Let's check the _update function for it:

```solidity
    function _update(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal override {
        require(!_blacklist[_to], "BK");
        bool _buy = _from == V2_POOL && _to != V2_ROUTER;
        bool _sell = _to == V2_POOL;
        uint256 _fee;
        if (_swapping == 0 && _swapAndFeeOn == 1) {
            if (_from != V2_POOL) {
                _processPreSwapFeesAndSwap();
            }
            if (_buy && _fees.buy > 0) {
                _fee = (_amount * _fees.buy) / DEN;
                super._update(_from, address(this), _fee);
            } else if (_sell && _fees.sell > 0) {
                _fee = (_amount * _fees.sell) / DEN;
                super._update(_from, address(this), _fee);
            } else if (!_buy && !_sell && _config.hasTransferTax) {
                _fee = _amount / 10000; // 0.01%
                _fee = _fee == 0 && _amount > 0 ? 1 : _fee;
                super._update(_from, address(this), _fee);
            }
        }
        _processBurnFee(_fee); 
        super._update(_from, _to, _amount - _fee);
```

If the _from is not V2_pool, it always tries to swap tokens to PAIRED_LP_TOKEN and then it deposits those tokens to rewards contract in `_processPreSwapFeesAndSwap` function. 

The problem occurs in [rewards contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L214). If there is no LP token staking yet in the contract, it will expect to get rewardsToken from deposit reward function. 

```solidity
        if (totalShares == 0) {
            require(_token == rewardsToken, "R"); // @audit it will revert unexpectedly if there is no shares
                                                  // deposit reward with PAIRED_LP 
            _burnRewards(_amountTotal);
            return;
        }
```

Attacker can lock the pTKN transfers in attack vector provided in "Attack Path" heading.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. It should be a fresh pTKN 
2. PAIRED_ASSET != rewardsToken

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

1. A new pTKN is created by Alice
2. Attacker saw the pTKN creation of Alice
3. Attacker bonded some amounts of underlying tokens to pTKN
4. Attacker manually added some liquidity to V2_Pool with paired asset in order to pass the following if check:

```solidity
        uint256 _lpBal = balanceOf(V2_POOL);
        uint256 _min = block.chainid == 1 ? _lpBal / 1000 : _lpBal / 4000; // 0.1%/0.025% LP bal
                                                                                                 
        uint256 _max = _lpBal / 100; // 1%
        if (_bal >= _min && _lpBal > 0) {
```

5. Now he donated some amount of pTKN to pod contract it self
6. The if check will be passed after donation
7. Now, every transfer function will be DoSed because Pod contract will try to swap the tokens and then it will try to deposit to reward contract
8. There is no supply currently because Attacker didn't use staking pool
9. LP_PAIRED_ASSET doesn't have to be equal to rewardsToken in rewards contract and all the transactions will revert in pod contract.

### Impact

All the transactions of pTKN contract are DoSed. The pod can't be used anymore until supplying some LP token to staking pool. User can't use bond function anymore because _mint function will call _update function and it will try to deposit reward again and it will revert again.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is not trivial
