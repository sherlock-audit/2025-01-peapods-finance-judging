# Non-compliant ERC20 tokens will cause price oracle function to revert affecting protocol operations

### Summary

Assumption of standard ERC20 metadata implementation will cause price oracle functionality to fail for non-compliant tokens (like MKR) as the `getPriceUSD18` function will revert when attempting to call `symbol()` on tokens that return bytes32 instead of string.


### Root Cause

In `DIAOracleV2SinglePriceOracle.sol:19` the direct call to `symbol()` assumes all ERC20 tokens implement the metadata extension with string return type, which is not true for some tokens like MKR that use bytes32.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol needs to integrate a non-compliant ERC20 token (like MKR) as a `_quoteToken`
2. The non-compliant token must implement `symbol()` returning bytes32 instead of string

### External Pre-conditions

None


### Attack Path

1. Protocol integrates a non-compliant ERC20 token (e.g., MKR) as `_quoteToken`
2. Any call to `getPriceUSD18()` with this token address will attempt to call `symbol()`
3. The ABI decoder fails to handle the bytes32 return type when expecting string
4. The entire function call reverts
5. No price data can be retrieved for this token

### Impact

The protocol cannot obtain price data for non-compliant ERC20 tokens, breaking core oracle functionality for these assets. This impacts:
1. Any protocol operations dependent on price feeds
2. Integration capabilities with notable tokens like MKR
3. Protocol's ability to support a wider range of assets
