# FraxlendPair `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation` is never set, which allows avoidance of bad debt.


### Summary

FraxlendPair `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation` is never set, which allows avoidance of bad debt.

### Root Cause

In the [Guardian audit report](https://sherlock-files.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/additional_resources/peapods_lvf_Guardian_report.pdf), the H-09 issue points out that liquidators can intentionally leave a dust amount of collateral behind when liquidating. This prevents creating bad debt, and there would be zero incentive for other liquidators to liquidate the position as the gas cost may exceed the collateral value. This is effectively avoiding the creation of bad debt.

The Peapods team made a fix with `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation` which is the minimum amount of collateral that must be left if the position was not completely wiped out.

However, there is no setter function to this variable, and it is not set during initialization/constructor phase, which means this mitigation is incorrect, and the original attack path is open again.

```solidity
    if (_leftoverCollateral <= 0) {
        // Determine if we need to adjust any shares
        _sharesToAdjust = _borrowerShares - _sharesToLiquidate;
        if (_sharesToAdjust > 0) {
            // Write off bad debt
            _amountToAdjust = (_totalBorrow.toAmount(_sharesToAdjust, false)).toUint128();

            // Note: Ensure this memory struct will be passed to _repayAsset for write to state
            _totalBorrow.amount -= _amountToAdjust;

            // Effects: write to state
            totalAsset.amount -= _amountToAdjust;
        }
@>  } else if (_leftoverCollateral < minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation.toInt256()) {
        revert BadDirtyLiquidation();
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

- Liquidators leave a dust amount of collateral during liquidation (e.g. 1 wei).

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

No one would be incentivized to liquidate the position, so the debt would continue to accrue interest.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add a setter for `minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation`, or at least set it during initialization.
