# The function _updateUserState in the VotingPool contract, under certain circumstances, causes users to be unable to reclaim their staked assets.

### Summary

In the contract `VotingPool`, a part of the logic in the function `_updateUserState` may prevent users from withdrawing their staked assets through the `unstake` function.

### Root Cause

This function(`_updateUserState`) implements the logic for updating the user's entitled vote tokens. It recalculates the number of vote tokens a user should receive based on the value of the assets they have staked, minting or burning vote tokens accordingly. This function should not affect the quantity of assets staked by the user or the process of asset redemption. However, due to the improper use of the `_burn` function, in some cases, result in the burn of all vote tokens held by the user (`_burn(_user, balanceOf(_user))`), which prevents the user from redeeming their staked assets through the `unstake` function.

Specifically, when the conditions `_mintedAmtBefore > _finalNewMintAmt` and `_mintedAmtBefore - _finalNewMintAmt > balanceOf(_user)` are met, the contract will execute the statement `_burn(_user, balanceOf(_user))`, destroying all vote tokens held by the user. If, at this point, the user wishes to redeem their assets, they would need to call the `unstake` function. However, since the user's vote token balance is now zero, this will trigger the revert statement `require(_amount > 0, "R")` in the `unstake` function, or cause a revert due to insufficient balance when burning vote tokens (`_burn(_msgSender(), _amount)`). Ultimately, this leads to the user being unable to retrieve their staked assets.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user needs to stake assets through the stake function.
The values of _convFctr and _convDenom need to change.
The user calls the update function.
The above conditions lead to the execution of the statement _burn(_msgSender(), _amount).

### External Pre-conditions

The values of _convFctr and _convDenom need to change.

### Attack Path

1. The user needs to stake assets through the stake function.
2. The values of _convFctr and _convDenom need to change.
3. The user calls the update function.
4. The above conditions lead to the execution of the statement _burn(_msgSender(), _amount).
5. A revert occurs when the user calls the unstake function.

### Impact

The assets staked by the user cannot be withdrawn.
