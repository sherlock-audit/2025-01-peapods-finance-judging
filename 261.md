# Asymmetric Calculation Between Amount and Shares

### Summary

During the deposit process, the `_redeem` function is called when certain conditions are met.
In the `_redeem` function, `_shares` is not consistent with `_amountToReturn`, leading to potential confusion in calculations.

### Root Cause

In the following code segment, `_shares` can be smaller than before, while `_amountToReturn` is not aligned with `_shares`.
This discrepancy can lead to several complex issues.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An external asset vault for `FraxlendPair` must exist.
2. The depositing amount must be greater than the total amount of FraxlendPair(`totalAsset.totalAmount(address(0))`).
3. `balanceOf(address(externalAssetVault))` must be less than `externalAssetVault.vaultUtilization(address(this))` within the `FraxlendPair`.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **Initial Deposit with Manipulated Ratio**: The malicious user calls the deposit function with a smaller amount of assets than intended, attempting to manipulate the amount/shares ratio to be lower than it should be.

2. **Subsequent Deposit with Higher Amount**: The malicious user then calls the deposit function again, this time with a larger amount of assets.

3. **Withdrawal of Excess Tokens**: The malicious user calls the withdraw function, attempting to withdraw asset tokens that exceed the total amount they have deposited.

### Impact

The deposit calculation may yield unexpected results, leading to unforeseen changes in the amount/shares ratio.
Additionally, a malicious user could manipulate the amount/shares, allowing them to deposit `FraxlendPair` tokens using fewer asset tokens.

### PoC

If `balanceOf(address(externalAssetVault))` is less than `externalAssetVault.vaultUtilization(address(this))` at the FraxlendPair, `_shares` is less than before and it is asymmetric with `_amountToReturn`.

### Mitigation

```solidity
    function _withdrawToVault(uint256 _amountToReturn) internal returns (uint256 _shares) {
        // Pull from storage to save gas
        VaultAccount memory _totalAsset = totalAsset;

        // Calculate the number of shares to burn based on the assets to transfer
        _shares = _totalAsset.toShares(_amountToReturn, true);
        uint256 _vaultBal = balanceOf(address(externalAssetVault));
        _shares = _vaultBal < _shares ? _vaultBal : _shares;

        // Deposit assets to external vault
        assetContract.approve(address(externalAssetVault), _amountToReturn);
        externalAssetVault.whitelistDeposit(_amountToReturn);

        // Execute the withdraw effects for vault
        // receive assets here in order to call whitelistDeposit and handle accounting in external vault
        _redeem(
            _totalAsset,
@           _totalAsset.toAmount(_shares, false).toUint128(),
            _shares.toUint128(),
            address(this),
            address(externalAssetVault),
            true
        );
    }
```
