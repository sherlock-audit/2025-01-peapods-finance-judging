# Incomplete logic will allow malicious users to perpetually override the amount to swap to the minimum

### Summary

Incomplete logic will allow malicious users to perpetually override the amount to swap to the minimum

### Root Cause

Multiple contracts, such as `TokenRewards`, have the following amount override mechanism:
```solidity
try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(...) {
            ...
} catch {
       _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride = _amountIn / 2 < REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN ? REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN : _amountIn / 2;
       IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
      emit RewardSwapError(_amountIn);
}
```
If a swap upon processing reward fails, we override the next swap amount to the current amount divided by 2 or by the minimum override amount if we go below it. This allows a user to maliciously set the override amount to the minimum perpetually due to multiple reasons.

Firstly, here we will get the rewards we have to process (`TokenRewards::depositFromPairedLpToken()`):
```solidity
uint256 _amountTkn = IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).balanceOf(address(this)) - _unclaimedPairedLpTkns;
```
An attacker can simply send 1 wei directly which in the case where `LEAVE_AS_PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` being false, we have to swap it to the reward token where we have the `try/catch` mechanism shown above. There, when we try to swap the 1 wei, we can revert for multiple reasons and an attacker can, with a 100% success rate, also make it fail by abusing the 63/64 rule as this is the last operation and the `catch` block is very simple. We can also revert due to other reasons as swapping 1 wei of token is not an actual legit swap and the DEX can reject it for numerous reasons but let's assume we abuse the 63/64 rule. Then, as 1 wei is below the minimum, we will go to the minimum of 1e9 which we don't have and further deposits will revert as we will try to swap amount we don't actually have, they will revert until 1e9 actually accrues. Then, the attacker can do it again and again.

### Attack Path

Explained in the root cause section.

### Impact

Firstly, an attacker can delay the distribution of actual rewards as there can always be an override to a low amount like 1e9.

Secondly, any operations will revert as if we don't have the minimum amount, swapping it will simply revert, this operation is done on stakes and unstakes. It will revert until 1e9 of rewards actually accrue which might take a long time. Then, the attacker can do it again after the rewards have been processed, resulting in a perpetual DOS of deposits and withdrawals, with very short windows where deposits and withdrawals will be possible in the time delta between the reward processing and the attacker doing it again which could, realistically, be 0 seconds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
  uint256 _amountTkn = IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).balanceOf(address(this)) - _unclaimedPairedLpTkns;
+ if (!LEAVE_AS_PAIRED_LP_TOKEN && _amountTkn < _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) { revert(); }
```
