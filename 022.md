# `deadline` not implemented in `unstakeAndRemoveLP()`

### Summary

The absence of a deadline check in unstakeAndRemoveLP will cause gas waste and fund lockup for users as network congestion can result in transactions executing after the deadline expires.

[similar issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance-kobbyeugene79/issues/2)

### Root Cause

In [unstakeAndRemoveLP](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/IndexUtils.sol#L104-L134), there is no validation of the _deadline parameter before initiating token transfers and unstaking operations. The deadline is only enforced in the downstream removeLiquidityV2 call, allowing transactions to proceed even if the deadline has expired.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Users must submit transactions with a `_deadline` that could expire before mining 


### External Pre-conditions

Ethereum network congestion causes delayed transaction mining 

### Attack Path

User calls `unstakeAndRemoveLP` with `_deadline = block.timestamp + 10 minutes`.

Network congestion delays mining by 15 minutes.

Token transfers and unstaking occur, but removeLiquidityV2 reverts due to an expired deadline.

User’s tokens are locked in the contract until manually refunded.

### Impact

1. Users suffer gas waste (500k gas ≈ $50) and temporary loss of access to transferred tokens.
2. Protocol accumulates dust tokens, complicating accounting and creating potential attack surfaces.
