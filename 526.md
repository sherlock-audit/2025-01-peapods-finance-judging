# frontrunning

**Description:**  
The protocol uses a fixed slippage value (`REWARDS_SWAP_SLIPPAGE = 2%`) for reward swaps but lacks dynamic slippage protection for certain operations. This exposes the protocol to front-running attacks, where bots can exploit predictable transaction outcomes.

**Impact:**  
- Increased slippage costs for users.
- Potential loss of funds due to unfavorable swap rates.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement dynamic slippage protection based on market conditions.
- Allow users to specify custom slippage values for sensitive operations.

**Code Reference:**  
```solidity
uint256 constant REWARDS_SWAP_SLIPPAGE = 20; // 2%
```
