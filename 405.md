# DOS Possible Due to no Minimum deposit Checks

### Summary

The lack of minimum deposit amount checks in the multiple contract deposit functions can be abused to create a DOS condition for the protocol as attackers can continuously submit dust deposits that consume resources and increase gas costs for legitimate users.

### Root Cause

In three key deposit functions, there is a lack of minimum deposit amount validation, allowing for dust deposits:

1. FraxlendPairCore.sol:624 - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L624-L624
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 _amount, address _receiver) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 _sharesReceived) {
    if (_receiver == address(0)) revert InvalidReceiver();
    // No minimum amount check before proceeding
    _addInterest();
    VaultAccount memory _totalAsset = totalAsset;
    if (depositLimit < _totalAsset.totalAmount(address(0)) + _amount) revert ExceedsDepositLimit();
    _sharesReceived = _totalAsset.toShares(_amount, false);
    _deposit(_totalAsset, _amount.toUint128(), _sharesReceived.toUint128(), _receiver, true);
}
```

2. LendingAssetVault.sol:106 - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L106-L106
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
    // No minimum amount check before proceeding
    _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(address(0));
    _shares = convertToShares(_assets);
    _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
}
```

1. AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol:124 - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L124-L124
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
    // No minimum amount check before proceeding
    _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);
    _shares = _convertToShares(_assets, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
}
```

In each implementation, deposits of any non-zero amount are accepted. While there are checks for zero amounts in the internal `_deposit` functions, there is no meaningful minimum threshold that would prevent dust deposits from consuming unnecessary computational resources.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs to have a small amount of the required deposit tokens
2. Attacker needs to approve the vault contracts to spend their tokens

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker acquires minimal amounts of required deposit tokens
2. Attacker approves vault contracts to spend tokens
3. Attacker repeatedly calls deposit() with dust amounts (e.g. 1 wei)
4. Each dust deposit triggers:
   - Full interest calculations
   - Reward processing
   - State updates
   - Event emissions
   - Share calculations
5. Protocol becomes congested with unnecessary computations and storage updates

### Impact

The protocol suffers from increased operational costs and reduced efficiency. Legitimate users experience higher gas costs for their transactions due to bloated state and excess computations. 

Each dust deposit forces the protocol to:
   - Execute full interest calculations via `_addInterest()`
   - Process rewards through `_processRewardsToPodLp()`
   - Perform share calculations and state updates
   - Emit deposit events
   - Update token balances and accounting

 The cumulative effect of many dust deposits results in:
   - Bloated contract storage from unnecessary state updates
   - Increased gas costs for legitimate users due to larger state reads/writes
   - Higher resource drain for interest and reward calculations
   - Event log spam affecting protocol monitoring and indexing
   - Fragmented share calculations potentially leading to precision inefficiencies

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement minimum deposit thresholds in all deposit functions:
```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_DEPOSIT = 1e6; // Adjustable based on token decimals

function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
    require(_assets >= MIN_DEPOSIT, "Deposit too small");
    // Rest of function...
}
```
