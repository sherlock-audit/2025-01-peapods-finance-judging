# `_amountIn` is overwriten if the `DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single()` fails

### Summary

`_amountIn` is overwritten if the `DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single()` fails thus leaving some of the `_amountIn` as `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` unaccounted for in the `TokenRewards` contract instead of swapping it for reward token.

### Root Cause

When swapping from `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` to reward tokens, if the swap fails, then the swap amount is cached in the `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` variable pending the next time rewards are accrued.

```solidity

File: TokenRewards.sol
292:     function _swapForRewards(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountOut, uint256 _adminAmt) internal {
293:         if (_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0) {
294:             _adminAmt = (_adminAmt * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
295:             _amountOut = (_amountOut * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
296: @>          _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride;
297:         }
298:         uint256 _balBefore = IERC20(rewardsToken).balanceOf(address(this));
299:         IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
300: @>      try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single( 
301:             PAIRED_LP_TOKEN,
302:             rewardsToken,
303:             REWARDS_POOL_FEE,
304:             _amountIn,
305:             _amountIn == REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN ? 0 : (_amountOut * (1000 - REWARDS_SWAP_SLIPPAGE)) / 1000,
306:             address(this)
307:         ) {
308:             _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride = 0;
309:             if (_adminAmt > 0) {
310:                 _processAdminFee(_adminAmt);
311:             }
312:             _depositRewards(rewardsToken, IERC20(rewardsToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - _balBefore);
313:         } catch {
314:@>           _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride =
315:                 _amountIn / 2 < REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN ? REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN : _amountIn / 2;
316:             IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
317:             emit RewardSwapError(_amountIn);
318:         }
319:     }

```

The problem is that if ` try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(...)` fails, and the `_amountIn` is cached in the `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` variable, the next time amount of `_swapForRewards()` is called in the execution flow, `_amountIn` will be overwritten to the previous `_amountIn` than could not be swapped instead of adding it to the current `_amountIn`.

Note also that the _adminAmt` is also overwritten as it will now be calculated based off of the cached value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

`try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single()` fails and is called another time when rewards are being accrued

### Attack Path

- `_amountIn`is overwritten by `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` when rewards are being accrued if the swap fails the `_amountIn` is cached
- the swap is done again during another accrual round
- instead of increasing the `_amountIn` by the previous amount that was cached in`_amountIn`, the `_amountIn` is over written to the previous `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride`.

### Impact

This can lead to loss of funds as the full `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` will not be swapped to reward token and as such will be stuck in the `TokenRewards` contract without a way to retrieve it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `TokenRewards::_swapForRewards()` function as shown below

```diff
File: TokenRewards.sol
292:     function _swapForRewards(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountOut, uint256 _adminAmt) internal {
293:         if (_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0) {
294:             _adminAmt = (_adminAmt * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
295:             _amountOut = (_amountOut * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
-296:             _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride;
+296:             _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride + _amountIn;
297:         }

```
