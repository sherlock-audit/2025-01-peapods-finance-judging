# Incorrect Exponentiation Operator in FullMath.mulDiv

A miscalculation in the `FullMath.mulDiv` function will cause incorrect inverse computation for smart contract users as developers mistakenly use the XOR operator instead of the exponentiation operator.

---

### **Summary**
In `FullMath.sol`, an incorrect operator usage will cause **wrong inverse calculation** for smart contract users as **the developer mistakenly uses the bitwise XOR (`^`) instead of exponentiation (`**`)**.

---

### **Root Cause**
In [FullMath.sol:86](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol#L86) the expression:
```solidity
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ^ 2;
```
incorrectly uses the **bitwise XOR (`^`)** instead of **exponentiation (`**`)**.
This results in a completely incorrect inverse value being calculated, leading to further miscalculations downstream.

---

### **Attack Path / Impact**
1. A developer calls `FullMath.mulDiv(a, b, denominator)` expecting accurate division.
2. The function computes `inv` incorrectly due to the use of XOR instead of exponentiation.
3. The final result is incorrect, leading to inaccurate token distributions, financial calculations, or staking rewards.
4. If this function is used in a DEX or lending protocol, incorrect calculations could result in unfair settlements or financial loss for users.

#### **Impact Statement:**
- **Smart contract users** will experience incorrect calculations, potentially leading to **loss of funds or broken logic** in DeFi applications.
- **Protocols relying on this function** may distribute rewards inaccurately or settle trades incorrectly.

### **PoC (Proof of Concept)**
#### **Incorrect Calculation (Current Code)**
```solidity
uint256 denominator = 7;
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ^ 2;  // XOR instead of exponentiation
console.log(inv);  // Incorrect value
```

#### **Correct Calculation (Fixed Code)**
```solidity
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ** 2; // Correct exponentiation usage
console.log(inv);  // Correct value
```

---

### **Mitigation**
1. **Replace the XOR (`^`) operator with exponentiation (`**`).**
   ```solidity
   uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ** 2;
   ```
2. **Use explicit multiplication instead of relying on `**`.**
   ```solidity
   uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) * (3 * denominator);
   ```
4. **Write unit tests to verify modular inverse calculations before deployment.**
This fix ensures correct modular inverse computation and prevents potential financial miscalculations in smart contracts.
