# Inconsistency in `totalAvailableAssetsForVault` Calculation


### Summary
In the `LendingAssetVault::totalAvailableAssetsForVault` function, the `vaultUtilization` should be used instead of `vaultDeposits`.

### Root Cause
The `vaultDeposits` represents the value that the `LendingAssetVault(LAV)` deposits into the `FraxlendPairVault`.

```solidity
        vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _assetAmt > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultDeposits[_vault] : _assetAmt;
```
However, due to underflow, this value can become incorrect and result in random values.

### PoC
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L73
```solidity
73: function totalAvailableAssetsForVault(address _vault) public view override returns (uint256 _totalVaultAvailable) {
        uint256 _overallAvailable = totalAvailableAssets();

        _totalVaultAvailable =
            vaultMaxAllocation[_vault] > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultMaxAllocation[_vault] - vaultDeposits[_vault] : 0;

        _totalVaultAvailable = _overallAvailable < _totalVaultAvailable ? _overallAvailable : _totalVaultAvailable;
    }
```
Consider the following example:
1. There are two `FraxlendPairVault` instances: `VaultA` and `VaultB`, both with the same state.
    vaultMaxAllocation[VaultA] = vaultMaxAllocation[VaultB] = 100 DAI.
2. Both `VaultA` & `VaultB` have `whitelistWithdraw 50 DAI`.
    `vaultDeposits[VaultA] = vaultDeposits[VaultB] = 50 DAI`.
    `totalAvailableAssetsForVault[VaultA] = totalAvailableAssetsForVault[VaultB] = 50 DAI`.
    `vaultUtilization[VaultA] = vaultUtilization[VaultB] = 50 DAI`.
3. Each Vault has accumulated interest of 10 DAI:
    `vaultUtilization[VaultA] = vaultUtilization[VaultB] = 60 DAI`.
    At this time `VaultA` and `VaultB`'s interestRate are same.
4. `VaultA` performs a `whitelistDeposit 60 DAI` and a `whitelistWithdraw 60 DAI`:
    After this, `vaultUtilization[VaultA] = vaultDeposits[VaultA] = 60 DAI`, `totalAvailableAssetsForVault[VaultA] = 40 DAI`.
As a result, the interest rate of `VaultA` increases, causing borrowers in `VaultA` to pay more interest compared to those in VaultB, leading to unfair profit distribution.
A malicious user can perform step 4 in the `FraxlendPairVault` and gain control over the interest rate.

### Impact
The calculation of `totalAvailableAssetsForVault` is inconsistent, creating unfairness for users.
The borrowers in `VaultA` pays more interest than the borrowers in `VaultB`, resulting in providers of `VaultB` earning less profit compared to those in `VaultA`.

### Mitigation
Consider using `vaultUtilization` instead of `vaultDeposits` to ensure accurate calculations and fairness among users.
