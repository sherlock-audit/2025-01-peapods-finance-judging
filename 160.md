# In `AutoCompoundingPodLp`, users can capture rewards during times they have not deposited in

### Summary

In `AutoCompoundingPodLp`, users can capture rewards during times they have not deposited in, resulting in loss of funds for honest and legitimate depositors

### Root Cause

Upon many operations such as depositing, we call `_processRewardsToPodLp()` to process rewards __BEFORE__ the user has deposited:
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);
        ...
    }
```
This is done so if Alice deposits 100 tokens, the rewards are distributed before her deposit, thus she can not capture rewards for times she has not staked in, this is staking 101. The issue is that upon calling `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` during the reward processing flow, we have this code:
```solidity
        try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_pairedLpToken, address(pod), _pairedSwapAmt, _minPtknOut, address(this)) returns (uint256 _podAmountOut) {
            ...
        } catch {
            IERC20(_pairedLpToken).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _pairedSwapAmt);
            emit AddLpAndStakeV2SwapError(_pairedLpToken, address(pod), _pairedRemaining);
        }
```
As seen, if the swap fails, we do not conduct the rest of the flow (use the token in and token out to provide liquidity, stake the LP tokens and receive the asset of the contract which increases the share value). Since the rewards were not processed, they will be processed on the next call. However, this is clearly an issue as Alice already deposited her tokens but the rewards were not processed, now she will unfairly capture rewards that do not belong to her. This can either happen maliciously by moving the price over the allowed slippage before the call or can happen with no malicious intervention during times of price movements.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice will deposit 100\$ of tokens, there are 10\$ of assets to distribute
2. Either due to price movements or a malicious intervention by Alice, the spot price during the swap is over the allowed slippage (5% of a price computed using TWAP and Chainlink), thus the swap fails and rewards are not processed
3. On the next call, they successfully distribute and the share value goes up, if we imagine there was 1 staker beforehand with 100\$ of deposits, then Alice will get 5\$ of his rewards and cause him a loss of 50% and 5\$, successfully passing the criteria for a High

### Impact

High as the lost rewards for a user can easily be over the High threshold as mentioned in the `Attack Path`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the rewards were not distributed, consider not allowing the deposit. Alternatively, increase the allowed slippage.
