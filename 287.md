# EIP-4626 Violation via Reward Processing in Deposit Flow

### Summary

The vault violates the ERC-4626 standard by allowing reward processing to alter asset/share ratios during a deposit transaction. This creates a mismatch between the `previewDeposit `(which shows expected shares) and the actual `deposit` execution (which calculates shares after rewards have changed the vaultâ€™s state).

### Vulnerability Details

For reference, the EIP-4626 specification states:

> "`previewDeposit:` MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be minted in a `deposit` call in the same transaction. I.e. `deposit` should return the same or more `shares` as `previewDeposit` if called in the same transaction."

### Impact
Does not comply with EIP-4626 standards
