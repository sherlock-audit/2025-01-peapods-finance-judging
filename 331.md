# Malicious Lenders can Increase the Interest owed by Borrowers Due to Wrong `UtilizationRate` Calculation

### Summary

The `UtilizationRate` is used to calculate the percentage of utilization of a specific Fraxlend Pair. This utilization is then used to calculate interest rates which are charged to the borrowers of the platform. Since the formula to calculate one of the utilization rates is wrong, it triggers the `_addInterest` function when it is not supposed to, causing malicious lenders to keep calling the function to inflate the interest of borrowers. 

The protocol team confirmed that the utilization rate needs to be the ratio of total borrowed tokens to the total borrowed + un-borrowed tokens in the contract. 

Currently, one of the utilization rate is calculated as the ratio between the total borrowed tokens to the total un-borrowed tokens. 

**A malicious lender can increase the interest of a borrower by more than `10%` every single day by doing this.**

### Root Cause

In the [`_addInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L457) function the calculation for the utilization rate of the Fraxlend Pair is wrong due to the following reason: 

The utilization rate is calculated as shown below: 
```solidity
uint256 _totalAssetsAvailable = _totalAssetAvailable(totalAsset, totalBorrow, true);
_prevUtilizationRate = _totalAssetsAvailable == 0 ? 0 : (UTIL_PREC * totalBorrow.amount) / _totalAssetsAvailable;
```

The first line gets the `_totalAssetsAvailable` from the following function shown below: 
```solidity
function _totalAssetAvailable(VaultAccount memory _totalAsset, VaultAccount memory _totalBorrow, bool _includeVault)
  internal
  view
  returns (uint256)
  {
    if (_includeVault) {
    return _totalAsset.totalAmount(address(externalAssetVault)) - _totalBorrow.amount;
  }
        ...
```

Here, the total asset in the contract plus the ones in the vault is subtracted by the total amount that is borrowed from the contract. 

If we take this into consideration, the formula for the Utilization Rate becomes: 

$$UtilizationRate = \frac{totalBorrow.amount}{totalAmountOfAssets - totalAssetsBorrowed}$$

Hence, the utilization rate becomes the ratio between total borrowed amount to total assets that are **currently** available in the contract to be lent out. This was communicated with the protocol and they agree that this is the wrong formula. 

The correct equation should be the ratio between total borrowed amount to the total borrowed + un-borrowed amount in the pair. 

Let's look at an example to understand this better, 

Let's take a Pair of tokens `X` asset, and `Y` collateral. 
* We have `100 X` assets, and `100 Y` collateral. 
* `50 X` assets have been borrowed by Alice.
* Now the pair has `50 X` assets, and `100 Y` collateral. 

Let's calculate the utilization rate: 

**Current Formula:** 

$$UtilizationRate = \frac{totalBorrow.amount}{totalAmountOfAssets - totalAssetsBorrowed} = \frac{50}{100-50} = 1.0$$

This gives a `100%` utilization rate. 

**Corrected Formula:** 

$$UtilizationRate = \frac{totalBorrow.amount}{totalAmountOfAssets} = \frac{50}{100} = 0.5$$

This gives a `50%` utilization rate. 

In this example, the rate change is `100-50 = 50%`, so it can trigger interest accrual even when it is not required. To understand the full impact of this error, we need to know the different types of interest a user can create for their Pairs of token. 

1. Linear Interest Rate: This interest is a simple linear interest following the equation `y = mx + c`, it has a vertex utilization after which the interest rate increases more rapidly. 
2. Variable Interest Rate: This interest is a more complicated interest rate that changes the `vertex` and `max interest` dynamically with the utilization. 

The problem occurs because if you call the `addInterest` function and update the interest rates when it is not required, you can steal more interest from the borrowers than necessary. This is shown in the Attack Path section below. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

A Fraxlend Pair is created. 

### External Pre-conditions

A user calls the `addInterest` function to update the interest states. 

### Attack Path
1. A FraxLend Pair is created with a variable interest rate with `60 MIN_TARGET_UTIL`, and `70 MAX_TARGET_UTIL`.  Interest rate of `1%` minimum, `2%` vertex, and `15%` maximum. 
2. `100` assets are deposited and `50` are loaned out to borrowers. 
3. Nothing changes, and the user calls `addInterest` to update interest rates. This can be called every block. 

From this point forward, lets look at the current method and the correct method to check state changes: 

**Current:**
Everyday the function is called with no change in utilization: 
The function calculates the current full utilization rate by: 
```solidity
function getFullUtilizationInterest(uint256 _deltaTime, uint256 _utilization, uint64 _fullUtilizationInterest)
        ...
        if (_utilization < MIN_TARGET_UTIL) {
            // 18 decimals
            uint256 _deltaUtilization = ((MIN_TARGET_UTIL - _utilization) * 1e18) / MIN_TARGET_UTIL;
            // 36 decimals
            uint256 _decayGrowth = (RATE_HALF_LIFE * 1e36) + (_deltaUtilization * _deltaUtilization * _deltaTime);
            // 18 decimals
            _newFullUtilizationInterest = uint64((_fullUtilizationInterest * (RATE_HALF_LIFE * 1e36)) / _decayGrowth);
        }
```

For our situation, we will get `_newFullUtilizationInterest = 0.14210526315789473`. 

And using this they calculate the `_newRatePerSec`: 
```solidity
uint256 _vertexInterest =
            (((_newFullUtilizationInterest - ZERO_UTIL_RATE) * VERTEX_RATE_PERCENT) / RATE_PREC) + ZERO_UTIL_RATE;
        if (_utilization < VERTEX_UTILIZATION) {
            // 18 decimals
            _newRatePerSec =
                uint64(ZERO_UTIL_RATE + (_utilization * (_vertexInterest - ZERO_UTIL_RATE)) / VERTEX_UTILIZATION);
```

Which will give us `_newRatePerSec = 0.02048454469507101`. This will be used to calculate the interest for each borrower and the interest is charged. 

If you call this daily for 30 days, the `_newRatePerSec` will decrease slowly as shown below: 
```bash 
0.02048454469507101
0.019890955458822496
...
0.011688161515964891
0.011557539815458803
```
On average, a person will pay `0.014938491983740592 ` or `1.4938%` interest. 

**Correct:** 
In the correct implementation of this hypothetical situation, the borrowers will only need to pay interest once in the 30 days at the end *if* utilization changes, giving them quite a lot less interest of `0.013670634920634922 ` or `1.367%`. 

**In this example alone, the borrower had to pay `0.1268%` interest more than they are required.** 

Another situation can be created for a utilization rate that is greater than the vertex utilization rate. When that is done, the interest rate increases from `12.250%` to `22.89%` in a single day. This can negatively affect the borrowers too, even though there is no change in utilization. Ideally, the utilization will decrease and the interest rate will decrease sequentially, but that will not happen if the utilization remains the same even for a block because the `addInterest` function can be called every block.  

### Impact

This wrong calculation is only used in the calculation of `_prevUtilizationRate`. This variable is only used in the `addInterest` function to calculate whether the interest needs to be updated or not:

```solidity 
uint256 _currentUtilizationRate = _prevUtilizationRate;
uint256 _totalAssetsAvailable = totalAsset.totalAmount(address(externalAssetVault));
uint256 _newUtilizationRate =
    _totalAssetsAvailable == 0 ? 0 : (UTIL_PREC * totalBorrow.amount) / _totalAssetsAvailable;
@> uint256 _rateChange = _newUtilizationRate > _currentUtilizationRate
    ? _newUtilizationRate - _currentUtilizationRate
    : _currentUtilizationRate - _newUtilizationRate;
if (
    _currentUtilizationRate != 0
        && _rateChange < _currentUtilizationRate * minURChangeForExternalAddInterest / UTIL_PREC
) {
    emit SkipAddingInterest(_rateChange);
} else {
    (, _interestEarned, _feesAmount, _feesShare, _currentRateInfo) = _addInterest();
}
```

Due to this, lender can maliciously call the `addInterest` function to increase the amount of interest the borrowers have to pay. They can call the function every block and increase the interest.
