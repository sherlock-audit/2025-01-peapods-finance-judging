# `AutoCompoundingPodlLp::_getSwapAmount` assumes tokens are sorted

### Summary

`AutoCompoundingPodlLp::_getSwapAmount` assumes tokens are already sorted, in the case where tokens are not in correct order, this can lead to significant loss of lp tokens and rewards to depositors


### Root Cause

The `_getSwapAmount` function is only called from `AutoCompoundingPodlLp::_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` to calculate the amount of paired tokens to swap for pod tokens before adding liquidity to the pool.

```solidity
function _pairedLpTokenToPodLp(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _deadline) internal returns (uint256 _amountOut) {
	address _pairedLpToken = pod.PAIRED_LP_TOKEN();
	uint256 _pairedSwapAmt = _getSwapAmt(_pairedLpToken, address(pod), _pairedLpToken, _amountIn); // <@ audit
	uint256 _pairedRemaining = _amountIn - _pairedSwapAmt;
	uint256 _minPtknOut;
	//...SNIP...
}

function _getSwapAmt(address _t0, address _t1, address _swapT, uint256 _fullAmt) internal view returns (uint256) {
	(uint112 _r0, uint112 _r1) = DEX_ADAPTER.getReserves(DEX_ADAPTER.getV2Pool(_t0, _t1)); // <@ audit
	uint112 _r = _swapT == _t0 ? _r0 : _r1;
	return (_sqrt(_r * (_fullAmt * 3988000 + _r * 3988009)) - (_r * 1997)) / 1994;
}
```

It is important to understand why this is necessary to understand why it is an issue.
Adding liquidity to a uniswapV2 pool requires adding both tokens in proportional amounts to their respective reserves, not doing so will result in a loss of lp tokens the more imbalanced the amount of token added are compared to the pools reserves. [for a more detailed reference/explanation see here](https://jeiwan.net/posts/programming-defi-uniswapv2-1/) #Pooling Liquidity.

https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/ee547b17853e71ed4e0101ccfd52e70d5acded58/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124

```solidity
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
           liquidity = Math.sqrt(amount0.mul(amount1)).sub(MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY);
          _mint(address(0), MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY); // permanently lock the first MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY tokens
       } else {
           liquidity = Math.min(amount0.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve0, amount1.mul(_totalSupply) / _reserve1);// <@ audit
       }
```

consider this case: for simplicity we're assuming the token prices are 1:1 so equal reserves as well,

- \_totalSupply = 1000
- \_reserve0 = 1000
- \_reserve1 = 1000
- amount0 = 500
- amount1 = 50

Liquidity minted would be the min. which in this case is = 50 _ 1000 / 1000 = 50.
If the user instead swaps ~225 token0 to token1 (i.e. so both tokens are balanced at 275 each) their lp minted would be ~ 275 _ 1000 / 1000 = ~ 275 (assuming swap is not done on same pool for simplicity, the formula used in the code obviously accounts for that).
This means the user looses ~225 Lp tokens by adding unbalanced liquidity to the pool.

Similarly, because `_getSwapAmount` assumes the first token as token0 and 2nd as token1, if this is not the case then the amount of paired token to be swapped for pod tokens will be incorrect (as the wrong reserve will be used in the calculation) and will lead to loss of lp tokens due to adding unbalanced liquidity to the pool.


### Internal Pre-conditions

NONE

### External Pre-conditions

NONE

### Attack Path

NONE

### Impact

High - loss of lp tokens (rewards to depositors) due to addition of unbalanced liquidity to pool


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Sort tokens before calculating swapAmount

```solidity
function _getSwapAmt(address _t0, address _t1, address _swapT, uint256 _fullAmt) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (_t0, _t1) = _t0 < _t1 ? (_t0, _t1) : (_t1, _t0); //<@
	(uint112 _r0, uint112 _r1) = DEX_ADAPTER.getReserves(DEX_ADAPTER.getV2Pool(_t0, _t1)); // <@ audit
	uint112 _r = _swapT == _t0 ? _r0 : _r1;
	return (_sqrt(_r * (_fullAmt * 3988000 + _r * 3988009)) - (_r * 1997)) / 1994;
}
```
