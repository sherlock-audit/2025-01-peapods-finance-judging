# Missing an amount override mechanism allows for perpetually disallowing accrual of rewards

### Summary

Missing an amount override mechanism allows for perpetually disallowing accrual of rewards in `AutoCompoundingPodLp`

### Root Cause

Upon almost every place in the code, upon having any type of swap, we have an amount override mechanism which aims to handle a failed swap by overriding the next swap amount in by the current amount in divided by 2.
This achieves 2 things:
- firstly, the amount is smaller making it more illogical for someone to decide to abuse it and also, automatically makes potential slippage during the swap smaller as the amount to swap is smaller, simply how AMMs work
- secondly, the slippage is removed fully if we have reached the minimum amount to swap

The issue is that upon reaching `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` during the reward processing flow in `AutoCompoundingPodLp`, that mechanism is completely missing:
```solidity
        try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_pairedLpToken, address(pod), _pairedSwapAmt, _minPtknOut, address(this)) returns (uint256 _podAmountOut) {
            ...
            try indexUtils.addLPAndStake(pod, _podAmountOut, _pairedLpToken, _pairedRemaining, _pairedRemaining, lpSlippage, _deadline) returns (uint256 _lpTknOut) {
               ...
            } catch {
                IERC20(pod).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(indexUtils), _podAmountOut);
                IERC20(_pairedLpToken).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(indexUtils), _pairedRemaining);
                emit AddLpAndStakeError(address(pod), _amountIn);
            }
        } catch {
            IERC20(_pairedLpToken).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _pairedSwapAmt);
            emit AddLpAndStakeV2SwapError(_pairedLpToken, address(pod), _pairedRemaining);
        }
```
As seen, in both `catch` blocks, we simply decrease the allowance. The outer `catch` is more problematic as the slippage there is just 5%, compared to the 30% in the inner one. This simply allows malicious users (or drastic price movements) to perpetually disallow accrual of the rewards.

NOTE: The `_minPtknOut` is computed using current prices during the call. However, it uses a combination of `TWAP` and `Chainlink` which means that the actual current spot price will likely differ and can go over the slippage. This can also, of course, be abused by malicious users by swapping before the function call and moving the spot price over the allowed slippage.

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

No attack path necessary, it is sufficiently explained in `Root Cause`

### Impact

Rewards can be perpetually disallowed from accruing

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement the typical amount override mechanism you have implemented in many place in the code
