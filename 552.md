# Double Debond Fee Application in `_calculateBasePerPTkn()`

### Summary

The debond fee is applied twice when calculating `_spTknBasePrice18` in the `spTknMinimalOracle` contract. This causes mispricing of `spTkn` which is used as collateral in the fraxlend pairs, allowing excess borrows.

### Root Cause

in the `spTknMinimalOracle`, when `getPrices()` is called, the _calculateBasePerPTkn function makes two adjustements. One for the pod CBR, and one for the unwrap fee: https://github.com/peapodsfinance/contracts/blob/cb71391952a4e27653816046c1947bcc3ba32066/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L214-L220

But when accounting for the CBR, it uses .convertToAssets() on the pod, which already accounts for the unwrap/debond fee:
https://github.com/peapodsfinance/contracts/blob/cb71391952a4e27653816046c1947bcc3ba32066/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L128

So the debond fee is incorrectly applied twice when pricing the spTkn in the oracle.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Base token is a pod token

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

spTkn token price is overvalued

Since it is used as collateral in lending pairs, borrowers in the FraxLend pair will be able to borrow more tokens than expected making it easier to reach bad debt without liquidation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Dont apply the debond fee twice
