# Inaccessible owner functions in LeverageManager due to ownership transfer to LeverageFactory

### Summary

The `LeverageManager` contains multiple functions restricted by the `onlyOwner` modifier. While the ownership is transferred to the `LeverageFactory` contract during deployment, the factory contract lacks the necessary interface methods to utilize these owner-restricted functions, effectively making them permanently inaccessible.

### Root Cause

The architectural design assumes that the `LeverageFactory` should be the owner of `LeverageManager` instances.

The `LeverageFactory` needs to call `setLendingPair` on the LeverageManager during the `addLvfSupportForPod` function, as seen in [LeverageFactory.sol:143](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageFactory.sol#L143):

The [`setLendingPair`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManagerAccessControl.sol#L17) function is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier in `LeverageManagerAccessControl`, necessitating the factory to be the owner.

However, while the factory needs ownership to perform these functions, it fails to implement the necessary interface methods to access other owner-restricted functionality of the managers it owns. This creates a pattern where owner functions exist but can never be called.

### Internal Pre-conditions

`LeverageManager`'s ownership is transferred to `LeverageFactory`.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

The inaccessible owner functions affect several scenarios:

1. **Flash source management**: The `setFlashSource()` function cannot be called to add or remove flash sources, preventing any updates to this functionality.

2. **Emergency fund recovery**: If tokens get stuck in the contract, the `rescueTokens()` and `rescueETH()` functions cannot be executed, resulting in permanent loss of funds.

3. **Fee adjustments**: The `setOpenFeePerc()` and `setCloseFeePerc()` functions cannot be used to adjust fees.

4. **Configuration updates**: Parameters like `feeReceiver` and `indexUtils` cannot be updated, which could result in the contract using outdated configurations.

### Impact

The inaccessibility of owner-restricted functions in the `LeverageManager` creates a permanently frozen protocol configuration that cannot be modified or upgraded. Operations including emergency fund recovery, fee adjustments, and flash loan source updates become impossible.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either implement proxy functions in `LeverageFactory` to access all owner-restricted functions of `LeverageManager`, or introduce a dedicated role in `LeverageManager` that would allow the factory to only manage lending pairs while keeping core administrative functions with a separate owner.
