# Stable pairs on aerodrome are un-usable

### Summary

Stable is hardcoded to false, meaning that we would not be able to use any stable pools on aerodrome ( `USDC : USDT` оr `WETH : stETH` ), even if they have the highest liquidity for the pair and thus the lowest slippage and fee.

### Root Cause

We have hardcoded `stable` to false, meaning that we would not be able to use aerodrome stable pools:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/AerodromeDexAdapter.sol#L71
```solidity
        _routes[0] = IAerodromeRouter.Route({
            from: _tokenIn,
            to: _tokenOut,
            stable: false,
            factory: IAerodromeRouter(V2_ROUTER).defaultFactory()
        });

```


We can see from aerodrome's code that we are not able to get a stable pool is stable is false

https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/main/contracts/Router.sol#L70
```solidity
    function poolFor(address tokenA, address tokenB, bool stable, address _factory) public view returns (address pool) {
        address _defaultFactory = defaultFactory;
        address factory = _factory == address(0) ? _defaultFactory : _factory;
        if (!IFactoryRegistry(factoryRegistry).isPoolFactoryApproved(factory)) revert PoolFactoryDoesNotExist();

        (address token0, address token1) = sortTokens(tokenA, tokenB);
        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(token0, token1, stable));
        pool = Clones.predictDeterministicAddress(IPoolFactory(factory).implementation(), salt, factory);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The contract will not work with stable pools in general.

### Impact

The stable  pools can be the ones with highest liquidity and thus lowest slippage and fees. Even more true if we are swapping between stable pairs like `USDC : USDT` оr `WETH : stETH`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding the ability to add stable to the input parameters.
