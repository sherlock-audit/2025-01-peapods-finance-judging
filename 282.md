# Double Protocol Fee Deduction for PAIRED_LP_TOKEN Rewards

### Summary
When processing rewards of`PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` with the `AutoCompoundingPodLP:_processRewardsToPodLp`, the protocol fee is applied twice: once in the balance calculation and again during conversion. This results in an incorrect higher fee deduction.

### Vulnerability Details

Let's walk through the flow for the `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` rewards:

When looping over reward tokens, if the token equals the `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN`, the contract calculates:


```solidity
uint256 _bal = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (_token == pod.PAIRED_LP_TOKEN() ? _protocolFees : 0)
```

This subtracts the already accrued `_protocolFees` from the balance.

Next, `_tokenToPodLp` is called with `_amountIn` set to` _bal`. For the `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN`,` _tokenToPairedLpToken` simply returns the input amount 

Then,` _tokenToPodLp` calculates:

```solidity
uint256 _pairedFee = (_pairedOut * protocolFee) / 1000;
_protocolFees += _pairedFee;
_pairedOut -= _pairedFee;
```

Here the protocol fee is deducted again from the amount that already had the fee subtracted in the balance calculation.

### Impact
Because the fee is first deducted in the balance retrieval (by subtracting `_protocolFees`) and then again applied during conversion, the `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` rewards suffer a double fee deduction

### Tool Used
Manual review

### Recommendation
Exempt `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` from the protocol fee during conversion if already accounted for in the initial balance adjustment
