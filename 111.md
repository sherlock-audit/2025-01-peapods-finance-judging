# Incorrect modifier results in the inability to set a staked user restriction

### Summary

Incorrect modifier results in the inability to set a staked user restriction

### Root Cause

Upon calling `StakingPoolToken.setStakeUserRestriction()` to set a user restriction, we use this modifier:
```solidity
    modifier onlyRestricted() {
        require(_msgSender() == stakeUserRestriction, "R");
        _;
    }
```
The issue is that if a restriction hasn't been set in the first place or has been removed, then this will always revert as the `msg.sender` can not be `address(0)` which is the `stakeUserRestriction` value if it hasn't been set.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The staked user restriction is removed or hasn't been set in the first place
2. There is no way to ever set it again in the future, resulting in a completely broken functionality

### Impact

Broken functionality rendering the staked user restriction mechanism completely useless. If a restriction must be set, then it will be impossible.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the modifier to a different one, possibly add the ability for the owner to set it
