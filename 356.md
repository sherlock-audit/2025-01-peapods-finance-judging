# Incorrect Accounting of `_totalAssets` in `_processRewardsToPodLp()` Can Inflate Vault Value and Cause Over-Issuance of Shares

The function [_processRewardsToPodLp()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L213-L231) is responsible for converting reward tokens into LP tokens and updating the vault’s total asset balance (`_totalAssets`). However, `_totalAssets` is updated before verifying the actual amount received from the LP conversion process, leading to a potential overstatement of assets in the vault.  

The [problematic code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L229-L230):  

```solidity
_totalAssets += _lpAmtOut;
require(_lpAmtOut >= _amountLpOutMin, "M");
```
 `_lpAmtOut` is assumed to be the final amount of LP tokens received, but this value may be incorrect due to slippage, fees, or failed swaps. If `_lpAmtOut` is zero or lower than expected, the vault’s total assets (`_totalAssets`) can be overestimated, making depositors believe the vault has more liquidity than it actually does. This can cause over-minting of shares, where depositors receive more shares than they should based on an inflated `_totalAssets` value. Later withdrawals may fail or be underpaid because `_totalAssets` was never truly backed by real liquidity.

## Impact  
This bug inflates the vault’s asset balance, potentially leading to the over-issuance of shares, meaning that users can withdraw more than what is actually available, causing an eventual shortfall and fund losses.  

## Mitigation  
Update `_totalAssets` only after successfully verifying that `_lpAmtOut` is valid and meets expectations.

```solidity
require(_lpAmtOut >= _amountLpOutMin, "M"); 
_totalAssets += _lpAmtOut; // @audit-ok Update only after validation
```
