# Users can abuse a reentrancy lock to disallow the share value from going up

### Summary

Users can abuse a reentrancy lock to disallow the share value from going up

### Root Cause

Users can abuse a reentrancy lock upon `DecentralizedIndex::burn()` to disallow the share value from going up:
```solidity
function burn(uint256 _amount) external lock { ... }
```
The `_burnRewards()` function has the following code:
```solidity
try IPEAS(rewardsToken).burn(_burnAmount) {} catch {
            IERC20(rewardsToken).safeTransfer(address(0xdead), _burnAmount);
}
```
If we call `burn()` on a locked pod (pOHM is one of the most recommended paired LP tokens in the website which is a pod), we would revert, go in the catch and transfer to the dead address. However, burning and transferring have different state changes - one is a simple transfer while the other one decreases the total supply. In this case, we would simply transfer and the total supply won't go down which means the share value won't go down as expected.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user, Alice, targets a `TokenRewards` contract which has an underlying pod where the `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is a reward token (an expected scenario handled by the code), the `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is `pOHM` which is a pod, this is one of the recommended paired LP tokens in the [Peapods front-end](https://peapods.finance/app) upon creating a pod 
2. Alice calls `DecentralizedIndex.flashMint()` (`pOHM`) minting herself 0 tokens to avoid paying actual fees and has her malicious contract as the recipient, this locks the contract due to the `lock` modifier (`function flashMint(...) external override lock`)
3. She reenters into `TokenRewards.claimReward()` using her malicious contract which then calls `DecentralizedIndex.processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()` (this is not a `pOHM` index this time but if it was, the same issue will happen without the reentrancy part. This means that the `lock` modifier there won't revert, we locked the `pOHM` pod)
4. The checks in `_processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()` pass (note that `_shortCircuitRewards` is not 1 in this contract, it's 1 in the `pOHM` pod) and we go to `_feeSwap()` where the `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` is the reward token and we call `TokenRewards.depositRewardsNoTransfer()` with the paired LP token which is the `pOHM` pod
5. We get to `TokenRewards._depositRewards()` where we call `_burnRewards()` when the token provided is a reward token (our scenario)
6. We reach this code:
```solidity
try IPEAS(rewardsToken).burn(_burnAmount) {} catch {
            IERC20(rewardsToken).safeTransfer(address(0xdead), _burnAmount);
}
```
7. We fail to burn due to the locked `pOHM` pod and we simply transfer to the dead address, these result in different states as explained

### Impact

Share value will not go down as expected, that is the reason for burning. Also, the last user to withdraw will still have to pay fees as we have this check there to confirm whether he is the last one out:
```solidity
return _debondAmount >= (_totalSupply * 99) / 100;
```
As the total supply can not go to 0 as the shares are in the dead address, even the last user will have to pay fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is non-entirely trivial, consider changing the `pOHM` `lock` modifier to allow a call through the call explained in the function.
