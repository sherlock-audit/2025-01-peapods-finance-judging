# Malicious liquidator can intentionally leave dust amount of collateral and won't trigger bad debt handling

### Summary

Malicious liquidator can intentionally leave dust amount of collateral and won't trigger bad debt handling

### Root Cause

The root cause of issue is in [FraxlendPairCore contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L422C1-L423C9), `_newMinCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation` variable's setter function is commented and now it's equal to 0 by default. 

In Fraxlend, this value is used for protecting the position to leave dust amount of collateral while it has still debt on it. Liquidators are incentivized by liquidator fee and they get extra collateral bonus for liquidation. But if there is dust amount of collateral left, no one will liquidate this position to earn dust amount of collateral and the position won't trigger bad debt handling. 

```solidity
            if (_leftoverCollateral <= 0) {
                // Determine if we need to adjust any shares
                _sharesToAdjust = _borrowerShares - _sharesToLiquidate;
                if (_sharesToAdjust > 0) {
                    // Write off bad debt
                    _amountToAdjust = (_totalBorrow.toAmount(_sharesToAdjust, false)).toUint128(); 

                    // Note: Ensure this memory struct will be passed to _repayAsset for write to state
                    _totalBorrow.amount -= _amountToAdjust;

                    // Effects: write to state
                    totalAsset.amount -= _amountToAdjust;
                }
            } else if (_leftoverCollateral < minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation.toInt256()) { 
                revert BadDirtyLiquidation();
            }
```

In conclusion, this kind of positions won't trigger the bad debt handling in the pool.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Bad debt condition is required in the position

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

1. Malicious liquidator will liquidate the position by leaving 1 wei of collateral and the bad debt mechanism won't be triggered

### Impact

Position won't be triggered by the liquidators and it will cause insolvency in the pool because withdraw actions will withdraw more assets than it should, the last person who has shares on the pair may lose all of his funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Choose a reasonable value for `_newMinCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation` and do not allow liquidators to leave the position's collateral below that value.
