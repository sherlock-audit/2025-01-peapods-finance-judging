# `_swapForRewards` math is wrong, which would send a bigger fee to the admin

### Summary

`_swapForRewards` wrongly calculates the new amounts using an outdated value, which would cause the admin to receive a higher fee

### Root Cause

`depositFromPairedLpToken` would first reduce `_adminAmt`, then use it to calculate `_amountOut`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L149-L150
```solidity
        uint256 _adminAmt = _getAdminFeeFromAmount(_amountTkn);
        _amountTkn -= _adminAmt;

        // ...

        uint256 _amountOut = _token0 == PAIRED_LP_TOKEN
            ? (_rewardsPriceX96 * _amountTkn) / FixedPoint96.Q96
            : (_amountTkn * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _rewardsPriceX96;

        _swapForRewards(_amountTkn, _amountOut, _adminAmt);
```

Later it would use the same reduced amount to calculate the new amounts if `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0`, not knowing that `_amountOut (converted back into _amountIn ) + _adminAmt >  _amountIn`, which would result in `_adminAmt` + `_amountIn (needed for _amountOut)` to be bigger than `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L292-L297
```solidity
    function _swapForRewards(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountOut, uint256 _adminAmt) internal {
        if (_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0) {
            _adminAmt = (_adminAmt * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountOut = (_amountOut * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride;
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. 1k for swap, fee 10%, price - 2 USD
2. Admin fee = 1k * 10% = 100 fee
3. Out = 900 / 2 = 450

results:  **in = 900, fee = 100, out = 450**

1. `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` = 50
2. admin = 100 * 50 / 900 = 5.55
3. out =  450 * 50 / 900 = 25
4. in = 50

As we can see out `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` is 50, however we need 50 for the 25 out (as price is 2 USD), and out fee is 5.5, which is outside this 50, and not 10% of it, but 11%, which is a 10% increase in fee.

### Impact

Admin receives a higher fee
Math is wrong
Fee is outside the prev. `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` value, resulting in a bigger swap and a higher fee.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the `_adminAmt` to `_amountIn` when in the if:

```solidity
        if (_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0) {
            _amountIn += _adminAmt;
            _adminAmt = (_adminAmt * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountOut = (_amountOut * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride;
        }
```
