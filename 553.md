# Tokens waiting in `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` to be re-tried is not re-tried before `setShares` in `TokenRewards.sol`

## Vulnerability Details
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L292-L319

Whenever the reward tokens come in to `TokenRewards.sol`:

```solidity
function _swapForRewards(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountOut, uint256 _adminAmt) internal {
    if (_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0) {
        _adminAmt = (_adminAmt * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
        _amountOut = (_amountOut * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
        _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride;
    }
    uint256 _balBefore = IERC20(rewardsToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
    try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(
        PAIRED_LP_TOKEN,
        rewardsToken,
        REWARDS_POOL_FEE,
        _amountIn,
        _amountIn == REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN ? 0 : (_amountOut * (1000 - REWARDS_SWAP_SLIPPAGE)) / 1000,
        address(this)
    ) {
        _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride = 0;
        if (_adminAmt > 0) {
            _processAdminFee(_adminAmt);
        }
        _depositRewards(rewardsToken, IERC20(rewardsToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - _balBefore);
    } catch {
        _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride =
            _amountIn / 2 < REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN ? REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN : _amountIn / 2;
        IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
        emit RewardSwapError(_amountIn);
    }
}
```

There are some tokens that will be added to the variable `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` due to the fact that it needs to be re-tried since it failed to swap (maybe cause the DEX didn't have enough liquidity etc etc)

However, we can see that `setShares` does not attempt to re-try the amounts sitting there atleast once.

## Impact
1. Alice is a shareholder of TokenRewards.sol
2. Rewards come in and it is attempted to be swapped
3. The swap failed due to lack of liqudity from the DEX, and the token amounts are sent to `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride`
4. Some time passes (and now maybe the DEX has sufficient liquidity)
5. Bob becomes a shareholder of TokenRewards.sol through `setShares`

Since `setShares` does not retry the amounts sitting in `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` atleast once at the start, Bob's shares will now include the value of the rewards, **unfairly dilutiing Alice's shares of the rewards**.

## Recommendation
At the starting of `setShares`, retry `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` once.
