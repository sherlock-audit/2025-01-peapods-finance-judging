# No gap inside  `DecentralizedIndex`

### Summary

`DecentralizedIndex` is an abstract contract with storage variables

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L17
```solidity
abstract contract DecentralizedIndex is Initializable, ERC20Upgradeable, ERC20PermitUpgradeable, IDecentralizedIndex {

    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    uint16 constant DEN = 10000; // 10K
    uint8 constant SWAP_DELAY = 20; // seconds

    IProtocolFeeRouter PROTOCOL_FEE_ROUTER;
    IRewardsWhitelister REWARDS_WHITELIST;
    IDexAdapter public override DEX_HANDLER;
    IV3TwapUtilities V3_TWAP_UTILS;

    uint256 public FLASH_FEE_AMOUNT_DAI; // 10 DAI
    address public PAIRED_LP_TOKEN;
    address CREATOR;
    address V2_ROUTER;
    address V3_ROUTER;
    address DAI;
    address WETH;
    address V2_POOL;
``` 

that is implemented in `WeightedIndex`, which also has values

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L13
```solidity
contract WeightedIndex is Initializable, IInitializeSelector, DecentralizedIndex {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    uint256 private _totalWeights;

```

Both contracts are upgradable in mind, which can be seen from bot of them having `initialize` and inheriting upgradable contracts.

However if `DecentralizedIndex` gets upgraded it's storage would clash with `WeightedIndex` bricking both contracts and costing all of the funds inside `WeightedIndex`.

Note that this can be spotted in other places around the codebase.

### Root Cause

`DecentralizedIndex` missing a gap, while having upgradability in mind.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `DecentralizedIndex` is upgraded and 1 new variable is introduced
2. Storage clashes with `WeightedIndex`, causing the whole contract to be inoperable
3. All funds are lost

### Impact

If `DecentralizedIndex` gets upgraded it's storage would clash with `WeightedIndex` bricking both contracts and costing all of the funds inside `WeightedIndex`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement `gap[50]`
