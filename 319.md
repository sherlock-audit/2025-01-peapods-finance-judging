# Stuck rewards and broken invariant due to constant fee assumption

## Summary
One-sided LP supply uses a formula with fixed values designed for 0.3% fee liquidity pools. However, Aerodrome pools have non-constant fees that are subjects to changes. Refer to Aerodrome's [website](https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity?filters=volatile) - fees for volatile pools vary between 0.04% - 1%. Using a 0.3% one-sided supply formula for a pool with different fee percentage will end up with irretrievable leftover funds and non-functional one-sided supply. 
## Description
The one-sided supply formula was designed whenever we have to provide liquidity to a pool but we have some amount of token0 and none of token1. This formula helps us determine how much token0 should we swap for token1 so in the end both us and the liquidity pool end up with equal token0:token1 ratios and we perform a clean provision without any leftovers. The formula is as follows:

$$
SQRT(((2 - fee) * reservesToken0)^2 + 4(1 - fee) * amountToken0 * reservesToken0) - (2 - fee) * reservesToken0 / (2 * (1 - fee))
$$

This is currently implemented in [`_getSwapAmt`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L391-L395), however with fixed numbers designed for fee = 0.3% 
```solidity
    function _getSwapAmt(address _t0, address _t1, address _swapT, uint256 _fullAmt) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint112 _r0, uint112 _r1) = DEX_ADAPTER.getReserves(DEX_ADAPTER.getV2Pool(_t0, _t1));
        uint112 _r = _swapT == _t0 ? _r0 : _r1;
        return (_sqrt(_r * (_fullAmt * 3988000 + _r * 3988009)) - (_r * 1997)) / 1994; // @audit these numbers are for 0.3% exclusively
    }
```
Doing calculations for a specific fee percentage, but executing swaps at a different one will result in imperfect swaps and leftover tokens which will remain in the contract. These funds are also irretrievable as there is no rescue function. Having leftover funds defeats the whole purpose of implementing the one-sided supply flow hence this can be ruled as broken functionality. 

Additionally, the README states that there are no limitations on values set by external admins of integrated protocols. We observed on Aerodrome's website that volatile pool fees are not constant and have been changed in the past by Aerodrome fee managers. The issue has adequate probability and impact.

## Impact
Broken invariant of one-sided supply functionality
Stuck funds
## Mitigation
Rewrite `_getSwapAmt` to fetch `volatileFee` from Aerodrome's [PoolFactory.getFee](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/a5fae2e87e490d6b10f133e28cc11bcc58c5346a/contracts/factories/PoolFactory.sol#L114-L117) and adjust the `2-f` parts of the formula accordingly.
