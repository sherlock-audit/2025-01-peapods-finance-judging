# When using the stake function to stake assets and receive votes, it results in the re-locking of assets that the user has already unlocked.

### Summary

The `stake` function in the `VotingPool` contract does not take into account the user's existing initial assets when locking the new assets deposited by the user, leading to the erroneous re-locking of assets that have already been unlocked.

### Root Cause

Users stake their assets and acquire votes by calling the stake function of the `VotingPool` contract. During the period specified by `lockupPeriod`, the assets the user has staked will be locked until the period expires, at which point they can be `unstake`. The relevant code is as follows:

However, there is a scenario in which the user has already staked a portion of their initial assets using the `stake` function. After a certain amount of time has passed (greater than the `lockupPeriod`), the user's initial assets may be in an unlocked state. If at this point the user wishes to earn more votes by staking additional assets, they need to call the `stake` function again to stake the extra assets. As a result, the initially unlocked assets will be re-locked alongside the newly staked additional assets. This leads to the situation where the user's initially unlocked assets are mistakenly locked again for an additional period, preventing extraction during the time they should be in an unlocked state.
