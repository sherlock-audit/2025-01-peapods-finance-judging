# Pod price can be inflated and pods can be rendered useless

### Summary

Pod price can be inflated and pods can be rendered useless

### Root Cause

The root cause of issue is allowing anyone to burn their [pod](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L321) tokens. First depositor can easily inflate the price to very high points and can render the contract useless.

```solidity
    function burn(uint256 _amount) external lock {
        _totalSupply -= _amount;
        _burn(_msgSender(), _amount);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

No condition needed

### External Pre-conditions

No condition needed

### Attack Path

1. Attacker is the first depositor
2. He bond his tokens gets equal amount of shares based on the values.
3. Then he burns all of his token - 1
4. There is only 1 share right now
5. This 1 wei share's price will be equal to attackers total deposit amount

### Impact

In bond function there is a slippage for the users and thanks to this slippage users can still safely bond their tokens. But the problem is there is no limitation in attack vector. Attacker can inflate any pod price and can render any contract completely useless. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not let users to burn their tokens or put some limitations to that value
