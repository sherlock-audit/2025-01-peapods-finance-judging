# those users who unstake their asset completely cannot stakes again

### Root cause

users can stake in VotingPool contract to achieve reward but their assets will be locked for a period but users who unstake they cannot stake again

### Internal conditions

_convFctr = 1
_convDenom = 1

### PoC

1- user stakes 200 asset for first time [amtStaked = 0] 
_mintedAmtBefore = 0 * 0 / 1 = 0, amtStaked = 200, userBalance = 200 voting token
2- the user stakes 200 asset again after a while when _convFctr is bigger than first stake time [_convFctr = 2] 
_mintedAmtBefore = 200 * 1 / 1 =200 
amtStaked = 400 , user voting pool's balance = 400
_finalNewMintAmt = 200 * 2 / 1 = 400 

3- user decides to unstake whole  his/her balance after lockup period

_amount = 400
_amtStakeToRemove = 400 / 2 = 200
amtStaked = 400 -200 = 200, user's voting pool balance = 0

4-user wants to stake 100 asset again when _convFctr is 1

_mintedAmtBefore = 200 * 2 / 1 = 400
_finalNewMintAmt = 300 * 1 / 1 = 300

because _mintedAmtBefore minus _finalNewMintAmt is bigger than user's balance .hence , 0 will be passed to _burn function but this causes user's transaction will be reverted because _removeShares just accept those values which is greater than 0

```solidity
        function unstake(address _asset, uint256 _amount) external override {
        require(_amount > 0, "R");
        Stake storage _stake = stakes[_msgSender()][_asset];
        require(block.timestamp > _stake.lastStaked + _stake.lockupPeriod, "LU");
        uint256 _amtStakeToRemove = (_amount * _stake.stakedToOutputDenomenator) / _stake.stakedToOutputFactor;
        @>>> _stake.amtStaked -= _amtStakeToRemove;
        @>>> _burn(_msgSender(), _amount);
        IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _amtStakeToRemove);
        emit Unstake(_msgSender(), _asset, _amount, _amtStakeToRemove);
        }
```
```solidity
        function _updateUserState(address _user, address _asset, uint256 _addAmt)
        internal
        returns (uint256 _convFctr, uint256 _convDenom)
        {
        ...
        else if (_mintedAmtBefore > _finalNewMintAmt) {
            if (_mintedAmtBefore - _finalNewMintAmt > balanceOf(_user)) {
            @>>>    _burn(_user, balanceOf(_user)); //zero will be pass here as _amount
            } else {
            @>>>    _burn(_user, _mintedAmtBefore - _finalNewMintAmt);
            }
        
```


```solidity
        function _removeShares(address _wallet, uint256 _amount) internal {
        @>>> require(shares[_wallet] > 0 && _amount <= shares[_wallet], "RE");
        _distributeReward(_wallet);
        totalShares -= _amount;
        shares[_wallet] -= _amount;
        if (shares[_wallet] == 0) {
            totalStakers--;
        }
        _resetExcluded(_wallet);
        }
```

### Imapct
those users who unstake their asset completely cannot stake again

### Mitigation
_burn function just should be call with a value greater than zero
