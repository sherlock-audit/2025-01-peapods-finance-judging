# `processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()` will revert if the Staking pool token and Voting pool tokens rewards are not the same

### Summary

The developer confirmed in a Private thread that the `StakingPoolToken` and `VotingPoolToken` rewards tokens may or may not be the same.

The leads to an issue whereby the the `VotingPool` Token cannot be minted by anymore

### Root Cause

As shown below, `_update()` is called when `mint()` is called from either the `StakingPoolToken` contract or the `VotingPool` contract and the execution flow is shown below

```solidity
File: VotingPool.sol
114:     function _update(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) internal override {
115:         super._update(_from, _to, _value);
116:         require(_from == address(0) || _to == address(0), "NT");
117:         if (_from != address(0)) {
118:  @>         TokenRewards(REWARDS).setShares(_from, _value, true);


File: TokenRewards.sol
102:     function _setShares(address _wallet, uint256 _amount, bool _sharesRemoving) internal {
103: @>      _processFeesIfApplicable();

File: TokenRewards.sol
137:     function _processFeesIfApplicable() internal {
138:@>       IDecentralizedIndex(INDEX_FUND).processPreSwapFeesAndSwap();
139:     }

```

The problem is that the `processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()` function which is in line of the execution flow, requires that the caller must be the `StakingPoolToken` rewards token. Thus in a situation where the `VotingPool` and the `StakingPoolToken` have _different_ rewards tokens, then the function will revert when it is called from the `VotingPool`

```solidity
File: DecentralizedIndex.sol
286:     function processPreSwapFeesAndSwap() external override lock {
287: @>      require(_msgSender() == IStakingPoolToken(lpStakingPool).POOL_REWARDS(), "R");
288:         _processPreSwapFeesAndSwap();
289:     }

```

NB: The sponsor confirmed that the reward token for the `VotingPool` and the `StakingPoolToken` contracts may or may not be the same.

### Internal Pre-conditions

the `VotingPool` and the `StakingPoolToken` have _different_ rewards tokens

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

- the `VotingPool` and the `StakingPoolToken` have _different_ rewards tokens
- when a user stakes in the `VotingPool` contract the function will revert because the `POOL_REWARDS()` is not the same for the the `VotingPool` and the `StakingPoolToken` contracts

### Impact

This can lead to a DOS thus blocking users who intend to stake in the `VotingPool` contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying the `processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()` to ensure it can allow calls from both the `VotingPool` and the `StakingPoolToken` contracts irrespective of whether or not their reward tokens are the same.
