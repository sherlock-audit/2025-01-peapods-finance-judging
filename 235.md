# Incorrect calculation of withdrawing amount to external vault leads to DoS in `deposit` and `mint` functions in `FraxlendPairCore.sol`

### Summary

When assets are deposited into a FraxlendPair, it checks if the LAV is over utilized, and if so, it withdraws assets to the LAV in purpose of lowering the utilization rate. However, it does not check if the LAV has enough FraxlendPair LP to burn. As a result, deposit transactions revert.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is in [`_deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L606) function of `FraxlendPairCore` contract, where it does not check if the `extAmount` is greater than LAV's shares.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- LAV is over utilized
- LAV has not deposited enough asset to the affected FraxlendPair

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

- A DAI LendingAssetVault contract manages 3 FraxlendPairs
- 10000 DAI is deposited in total, and say 9000 DAI is deposited between 3 pairs, e.g. 4000 DAI, 4000 DAI, and 1000 DAI
- Alice deposits 1100 DAI into 3rd FraxlendPairs
- Since the utilization rate is 90%, the LAV tries to withdraw 1100 DAI to the LAV
- However, the LAV only owns 1000 DAI worth of FraxlendPair LP, so the transaction reverts

### Impact

Users are unable to deposit assets into FraxlendPair, leading to DoS.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The withdrawal amount should be checked to be less than or equal to the LAV's shares.

                }
            }
