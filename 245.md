# Incorrect swap output token provided in `LeverageManager` when the self-lending pair is podded

### Summary

The `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` of a pod can be one three types of assets:

- ERC20 like DAI
- FraxlendPair token, e.g. fDAI(pABC)
- Pod token of FraxlendPair

In initializing positions in `LeverageManager`, the parameter `_hasSelfLendingPairPod` is provided that indicates whether the paired lp token is a pod or just lending pair LP.

When removing leverage and borrow assets unstaked are not enough to pay back flash loan, some amount of `pTkn` is swapped into borrow assets. However, it does not consider the case when the paired lp token is a pod token of a FraxlendPair, which causes reverts in swap because the Uniswap V2 pool does not exist.

### Root Cause

The root cause is in [`_acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L434-L446) function of `LeverageManager` contract, where it does not consider the case when the paired lp token is a pod token of a FraxlendPair.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A pod is setup with podded FraxlendPair LP token as paired LP token

### External Pre-conditions

- A user has added a leverage position in `LeverageManager`

### Attack Path

- Alice had added a leverage position in `LeverageManager` for a pod with podded FraxlendPair LP token as paired LP token
- Alice attempts to remove her leverage
- 1000 DAI is borrowed from flash loan to repay the borrow assets on Fraxlend pair
- By unstaking `aspTkn`, she's got 200 `pTkn` and 800 DAI
- To repay the flash loan, some amount of `pTkn` is required to be swapped into DAI
- Since `pTkn`'s paired lp token is a pod token of a FraxlendPair, `pTkn / PairedLPToken` pair exists on Uniswap V2
- However, the contract tries to swap from `pTkn` to `fTkn`, where the pair does not exist on Uniswap V2
- Thus, the swap reverts

### Impact

Users cannot remove leverage when the paired lp token is a pod token of a FraxlendPair.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When the paired lp token is a pod token of a FraxlendPair, the swap output token should be the pod token instead of lending pair token.
