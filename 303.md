# `_tokenToPairedSwapAmountInOverride` overrides the current swap amount

### Summary

In the function `_tokenToPairedLpToken`, when a swap fails, half of `_amountIn` is stored in `_tokenToPairedSwapAmountInOverride` for execution in a future swap. 
However, the function overwrites `_amountIn` with `_amountInOverride`, causing the original swap amount to be lost. 

### Root Cause

In [_tokenToPairedLpToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L249-L301) a failed swap amount is stored in a mapping so it can be swapped later:
```js
  } catch {
            _tokenToPairedSwapAmountInOverride[_rewardsToken][_swapOutputTkn] =
                _amountIn / 2 < _minSwap ? _minSwap : _amountIn / 2;
            IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
            emit TokenToPairedLpSwapError(_rewardsToken, _swapOutputTkn, _amountIn);
        }
```
This swap will be executed later when a swap of the same token occurs. `_amountIn` holds the amount of the current swap and the problem is, the amount of the failed swap is not added to the current amount, rather the `_amountIn` is overridden and that way the current amount is lost. 
```js
    uint256 _amountInOverride = _tokenToPairedSwapAmountInOverride[_rewardsToken][_swapOutputTkn];
    if (_amountInOverride > 0) {
        _amountIn = _amountInOverride; 
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

`_tokenToPairedSwapAmountInOverride[_rewardsToken][_swapOutputTkn]` has a stored value from a previous failed swap attempt.

### External Pre-conditions

A user initiates a swap of a token that has a previous failed swap stored in `_tokenToPairedSwapAmountInOverride[_rewardsToken][_swapOutputTkn]`.

### Attack Path

1. A user deposits and `_processRewardsToPodLp` is called which calls `_tokenToPairedLpToken`.
2. A previous swap of the same token failed and the function stored half of `_amountIn` in `_tokenToPairedSwapAmountInOverride`.
3. Later, when a user swaps the same token again, `_tokenToPairedSwapAmountInOverride` is used but the original `_amountIn` is lost, because it is overwritten by `_amountInOverride`.
4. The swap executes using the old failed swap amount instead of the new `_amountIn` + `_amountInOverride`.

### Impact

The new `_amountIn` is lost because `_amountInOverride` overrides the `_amountIn` variable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not override `_amountIn` but increase it with `_amountInOverride`.
