# Adding leverage using a podded token will lead to a revert

### Summary

Adding leverage using a podded token will lead to a revert

### Root Cause

Pod tokens have a fee, they have a FoT token nature:
```solidity
    function _update(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal override {
        ...
        super._update(_from, _to, _amount - _fee);
    }
```
This is not considered in the flow upon adding leverage and will lead to a revert when the fees or the transfer tax are on.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Fees and transfer tax is on for the pod token which is expected, otherwise it leads to "loss of funds" as no fees are sent

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Bob adds leverage for a pod with a paired token which is another pod (expected and specifically handled in the code)
2. We add LP between the 2 tokens during the flow:
```solidity
_amountOut = _indexFund.addLiquidityV2(
            IERC20(_indexFundAddy).balanceOf(address(this)) - (_idxTokensBefore == 0 ? 1 : _idxTokensBefore),
            IERC20(_pairedLpToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - (_pairedLpTokenBefore == 0 ? 1 : _pairedLpTokenBefore),
            _slippage,
            _deadline
        );
```
3. The code above correctly handles potential fees during the transfer as it is using a typical balance before & balance after FoT handling code
4. Then we call `DecentralizedIndex.addLiquidityV2()` where we have this piece of code (NOTE: the function has a `noSwapOrFee` modifier which disables fees during the function call, however this is only for the `address(this)` pod token, not the `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` pod):
```solidity
IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _pairedLPTokens);
IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(DEX_HANDLER), _pairedLPTokens);

DEX_HANDLER.addLiquidity(
            ...
            PAIRED_LP_TOKEN,
            ...
            _pairedLPTokens,
            ...
        );
```
5. We then call `UniswapDexAdapter::addLiquidity()` with the following code there:
```solidity
IERC20(_tokenB).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amountBDesired);
```
6. We directly transfer the function input of token amount, however due to the fee application, we don't actually have enough tokens, note that this revert will happen when the transfer tax is on (expected) as it is not considered a buy nor a sell in the `_update()` override
7. If the transfer tax is not on for some reason, we will call the router where we then transfer to a V2 pool which incurs a sell fee, we would revert there

### Impact

The podded paired token functionality is unusable unless fees and transfer tax is disabled which then results in a loss of funds as no fees will be charged

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement some kind of a function which is called when we are working with a pod paired token which works in a similar way to the `noSwapOrFee` modifier and call it specifically on the pod paired token
