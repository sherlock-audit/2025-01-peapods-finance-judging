# Lack of Swap Path Configuration Permissions Leading to LP Hijacking

Summary: swapMaps can be arbitrarily set to malicious trading pairs, causing funds to be routed to the attacker's contract.

Detailed Description:

In the setSwapMap function (L470-473), the validity of the _pools parameter is not verified, allowing attackers to set malicious trading pairs to steal tokens.

Vulnerability: Swap Path Hijacking Vulnerability

Impact: Contract funds are transferred to the attacker's address via malicious trading pairs.

PoC:

<SOLIDITY>
// Attacker controls malicious trading pair
address attackerPool = deployMaliciousPool();
AutoCompoundingPodLp.Pools memory maliciousPools = AutoCompoundingPodLp.Pools(attackerPool, address(0));

// Set malicious path and trigger transaction
vm.prank(owner);
autoCompoundingPodLp.setSwapMap(inputToken, outputToken, maliciousPools);


// User deposit is hijacked
vm.prank(user);
autoCompoundingPodLp.deposit(100 ether, user);

Recommendation:

Add permission verification to allow only trusted addresses to modify swapMaps
