# An attacker will steal ETH for users as they will exploit `Zapper._ethToWETH`.

### Summary

The use of `deposit{value: _amountETH}` in `Zapper._ethToWETH` can cause a complete loss of ETH for users, as an attacker can redirect ETH to an arbitrary address.



### Root Cause

In Zapper.sol[#150](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Zapper.sol#L148-L152), the `deposit{value: _amountETH}` call allows ETH to be sent to an arbitrary address without proper validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users must send ETH to the Zapper contract.
2. The contract must hold ETH to be deposited into WETH.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must have a way to call `_ethToWETH` with malicious parameters.
2. The WETH contract must be functional to accept the deposit.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `_ethToWETH` with a malicious address as the recipient.
2. The contract deposits ETH into WETH and sends it to the attacker’s address.
3. Attacker steals the ETH by withdrawing it from WETH.

### Impact

The users suffers a **complete loss** of their ETH sent to the contract. **The attacker gains the stolen ETH, which can amount to 100% of the user’s principal and yield.**

### Mitigation

1. Validate Recipient Address: Ensure the recipient address is validated or restricted.
2. Use `msg.sender`: Send WETH to `msg.sender` instead of an arbitrary address.
3. Add Access Control: Restrict the function to authorized users or roles.
