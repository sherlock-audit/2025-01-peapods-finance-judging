# Users can lose all their pod tokens during removing leverage due to sandwich attack

### Summary

When users remove leverage, they need to pay back flash loan of borrow assets while they have some amounts of pod tokens and borrow tokens unstaked. When the unstaked amount of borrow tokens is less than the flash loan amount, some of their pod tokens are swapped into borrow tokens through Uniswap V2 pool to repay the flash loan.

However, there's no slippage protection for the swap, thus users can lose all their pod tokens due to sandwich attack.

### Root Cause

The root cause is in the [`_swapPodForBorrowToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L466) function, where it passes total `_podAmt` as `amountInMax` to Uniswap V2 router.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

The attacker needs to be able to sandwich the swap of pod tokens into borrow tokens.

### Attack Path

1. Let's assume Alice has 1000 DAI borrowed from flash loan which needs to be repaid
2. Alice has unstaked 200 `pTkn` and 800 DAI
3. Alice has to sell some of her `pTkn` to receive 200 DAI
4. Uniswap V2's `pTkn / DAI` pool has 10000 DAI and 1000 `pTkn`, which makes the price 1 `pTkn` = 10 DAI, making 20 out of 200 `pTkn` be swapped into 200 DAI approximately
5. The attacker swaps `2162 pTkn` for `6838 DAI`, makes it `3162 pTkn` and `3162 DAI` in the pool. The constant product `K` remains same as `1e7`
6. Since `pTkn` and `DAI` price is same, Alice pays 200 `pTkn` to receive 200 DAI (approximately)
7. After Alice's swap, the attacker swaps his DAI into `pTkn` again, making profit

### Impact

Users can lose their pod tokens upto 100%

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When `removeLeverage` is called, user has to provide max amount of pod tokens to sell.
