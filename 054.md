# `_updateExchangeRate` math is wrong, bad oracles are treated as good

### Summary

The bellow math performs one crucial mistake, it calculates the divergence, by using the higher value - `highExchangeRate` as denominator.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L552-L554
```solidity
        // 1e5 * (highExchangeRate - lowExchangeRate) / highExchangeRate
        uint256 _deviation = (
            DEVIATION_PRECISION * (_exchangeRateInfo.highExchangeRate - _exchangeRateInfo.lowExchangeRate)
        ) / _exchangeRateInfo.highExchangeRate;
```

This will cause values that should be equal or bigger than `maxOracleDeviation` to still be smaller than it, further allowing borrowing when the system should be stopped due to a faulty oracle.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L555-L557
```solidity
        if (_deviation <= _exchangeRateInfo.maxOracleDeviation) {
            _isBorrowAllowed = true;
        }
``` 

This bug is best shown with an example or two.


## Example1 (simple one to demonstrate the math):

$$
\frac{\text{highExchangeRate} - \text{lowExchangeRate}}{\text{highExchangeRate}} = \frac{15 - 10}{15} = 33.3\\%
$$

From this example we have secluded that the difference between 10 and 15 would cause a 33.3% divergence, not taking into account that 5 is 50% of 10.

## Example2 (realistic one):

| *prerequisite*     | *values* |
|--------------------|----------|
| lowExchangeRate    | 100k     |
| highExchangeRate   | 105.25k  |
| maxOracleDeviation | 5%       |

$$
\frac{\text{highExchangeRate} - \text{lowExchangeRate}}{\text{highExchangeRate}} = \frac{105.25k - 100k}{105.25k} = 4.98\\%
$$

Here even though the value difference between 100k and 105.25k is 5.25k we still pass the bellow 5% `maxOracleDeviation` and thus operate as normal allowing borrowers to borrow.



### Root Cause

Dividing by the `highExchangeRate` rather than the low one.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

There is no attack path per say, just a faulty environment where the bug would happen on occasion. Perhaps the attack would be a user to borrow at times when borrowing should be disabled, but isn't due to the faulty math.

### Impact

Oracles will function normally even when the deviation exceeds `_exchangeRateInfo.maxOracleDeviation`.
Invariant is broken.
The system allows users to borrow under a state where it's checks should stop borrowing:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L555-L557
```solidity
        if (_deviation <= _exchangeRateInfo.maxOracleDeviation) {
            _isBorrowAllowed = true;
        }
``` 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider dividing by the low one to make the system more secure and avoid possible failures. Alternative would be to use the average between the two.
