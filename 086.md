# Tokens will be stuck in `AutoCompoundingPodLp` if the intermediary swap token is not a reward token

### Summary

Tokens will be stuck in `AutoCompoundingPodLp` if the intermediary swap token is not a reward token

### Root Cause

Upon swapping between tokens when processing rewards in `AutoCompoundingPodLp`, we call `_swapV2()` where we either go through a direct swap or a multi hop swap where we have this code:
```solidity
if (maxSwap[_path[1]] > 0 && _intermediateBal > maxSwap[_path[1]]) {
                _intermediateBal = maxSwap[_path[1]];
}
IERC20(_path[1]).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _intermediateBal);
_amountOut = DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_path[1], _path[2], _intermediateBal, _amountOutMin, address(this));
```
We swap between the second and third token in the `_path` array. The issue is that if we have set a max swap for the in token and we cap that amount, then the rest of the tokens will be stuck in the contract forever if the token is not a reward token.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. We go through a swap such as `X -> Y -> Z` where `X` is a reward token and `Z` is the paired LP token we want to swap to, `Y` is an intermediate token for the swap as there is not a direct pool between `X` and `Z`
2. `Y` has a max swap amount of 100 tokens and it is not a reward token
3. We swap from `X` to `Y` and receive 150 `Y` tokens
4. We cap the `Y` tokens to swap at 100 and swap them for `Z` tokens
5. The 50 `Y` tokens are left stuck forever due to the cap, there is no way to take them out as it is not a reward token

### Impact

Stuck funds

### Mitigation

If the intermediate token is not a reward token, increment a value for that tokens of the tokens that are over the cap and implement a rescue function for them
