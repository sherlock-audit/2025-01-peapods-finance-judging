# wrong calculation leads to inaccurate interest earn

### Summary

In the **FraxlendPairCore** contract, the function **_addInterest()** calculates the **_prevUtilizationRate** using **totalAssetsAvailable**. To obtain this value, it calls the function **_totalAssetAvailable**, which sums the total amounts of external and internal assets, then subtracts **_totalBorrow.amount** to compute **_totalAssetsAvailable**. This value is then used to calculate **_prevUtilizationRate**.

In line 460, the function calls **_calculateInterest** to determine important variables such as **_utilizationRate**:
```solidity 
uint256 _totalAssetsAvailable = _results.totalAsset.totalAmount(address(externalAssetVault));
// Get the utilization rate
uint256 _utilizationRate =
    _totalAssetsAvailable == 0 ? 0 : (UTIL_PREC * _results.totalBorrow.amount) / _totalAssetsAvailable;
```

As we can see, when calculating **_totalAssetsAvailable**, we only add the total amounts of external and internal assets. We do not subtract **_totalBorrow.amount** as we did earlier, which leads to an incorrect **_utilizationRate**. Consequently, the new rate and **newFullUtilizationRate** will differ, resulting in inaccurate **interestEarned**.

### Root Cause

in FraxlendPairCore line 332 when calculating _totalAssetsAvailable it doesn't subtract **_totalBorrow.amount** 

### Internal Pre-conditions

 _addInterest() need to be called  

### External Pre-conditions

nothing 

### Attack Path

it works when ever the **_addInterest()** is called 

### Impact

loss of fund 
wrong interest calculation  

### PoC
