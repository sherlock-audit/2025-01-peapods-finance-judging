# All the burn and mint functions are impacted from incorrect _update handling if there is a fee

### Summary

All the burn and mint functions are impacted from incorrect _update handling if there is a fee

### Root Cause

In [Decentralized Index Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L159), update function is overrided by the protocol and some features are added. 

Transfers can have fees if user active hasTransferTax value in pod configuration but also there are other fees in buying and selling in V2 uniswap pool. The problem is _update function incorrectly handles burning and minting actions if there is some fee amount. 

For instance:

```solidity
    function _processBurnFee(uint256 _amtToProcess) internal {
        if (_amtToProcess == 0 || _fees.burn == 0) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 _burnAmt = (_amtToProcess * _fees.burn) / DEN;
        _totalSupply -= _burnAmt;
        _burn(address(this), _burnAmt);
    }
```
This function is called in _update function and it calls _burn function. In default ERC20 _burn, it will call _update again and it will reenter and it will burn some extra amount of fee.

This is just one example there are many other wrong handling in the contract for burn and minting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

There will be many impact on the contract. The biggest problem is wrong accounting of internal supply value. Because before every _burn function it first substract the whole amount from supply value, for instance:

```solidity
   function burn(uint256 _amount) external lock {
        _totalSupply -= _amount;
        _burn(_msgSender(), _amount); 
    }
```
Additionally, in fee burning part it's substracted again:

```solidity
    function _processBurnFee(uint256 _amtToProcess) internal {
        if (_amtToProcess == 0 || _fees.burn == 0) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 _burnAmt = (_amtToProcess * _fees.burn) / DEN;
        _totalSupply -= _burnAmt;
        _burn(address(this), _burnAmt);
    }
```

In conclusion totalSupply will be less than actual amount and it can completely DoS the pTKN if it reachs to value 0. Attacker can simply use that attack vector by burn function because protocol allows everyone to burn their pTKN.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In order to skip the _update function directly use 

```super.update(Alice, 0, 1e18)``` for burn
```super.update(0,Alice, 1e18)```for mint
