# Donation attack via ERC777

#### Issue Description
The smart contract calculates the output of swaps using balance differences (`balanceOf(recipient)`). This approach is vulnerable to donation attacks if the recipient is a contract implementing ERC777 or similar token standards with hooks. An attacker could manipulate the recipient's balance during the transfer, leading to incorrect calculations and potential fund loss.

#### Impact
This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate swap outputs, potentially draining funds from the protocol. The risk is exacerbated by the fact that the protocol does not restrict the use of "weird tokens" (e.g., ERC777) in its codebase, leaving it exposed to such attacks.

#### Proof of Concept
1. An attacker deploys a malicious ERC777 token with hooks.
2. During a swap, the attacker triggers the hook to temporarily increase the recipient's balance.
3. The protocol calculates the output based on the inflated balance, transferring more tokens than intended to the attacker.

#### Recommendation
Instead of relying on `balanceOf` to calculate output, use the actual amount returned by the swap function. For fee-on-transfer tokens, ensure proper handling by explicitly accounting for fees during transfers.

```solidity
// Before
uint256 _outBefore = IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient);
// ... perform swap ...
_amountOut = IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient) - _outBefore;

// After
(uint256 actualAmountOut) = IAerodromeRouter(V2_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokens(...);
require(actualAmountOut >= _amountOutMin, "Insufficient output");
```
