# Zero-Amount Swap Vulnerability in swapV2Single and swapV3Single

### Summary

The dust generated from swaps can be drained by anyone from the adapter contract, which leads to gradual loss of funds/value

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/AerodromeDexAdapter.sol#L62

In AerodromeDexAdapter.sol the swap functions check if _amountIn is zero and, if so, default to using the adapter’s entire token balance. This design flaw allows any caller to drain accumulated dust from the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The adapter contract holds a nonzero token balance (dust) from prior swap operations or rounding errors.
The caller sets _amountIn to zero in a swap call.
There is no authorization check restricting who can call the swap functions.

### External Pre-conditions
External liquidity operations (such as addLiquidity or removeLiquidity) contribute to the accumulation of residual (“dust”) tokens in the adapter.
The external protocols interacting with the adapter do not enforce strict dust management.


### Attack Path

The attacker observes that the adapter holds a residual token balance.
The attacker calls either swapV2Single or swapV3Single with _amountIn set to zero.
The adapter then uses its full token balance (the dust) for the swap, transferring those tokens to the attacker’s specified recipient.

### Impact

The protocol or liquidity providers suffer an approximate loss equal to the accumulated dust tokens. [The attacker gains the entire residual token amount present in the adapter.]

### PoC

An attacker sends a transaction to the swap function with _amountIn = 0, triggering the transfer of all residual tokens held by the adapter.

### Mitigation

Require that _amountIn is greater than zero before proceeding with the swap.
If dust sweeping is desired, implement it as a controlled, owner-only function rather than within public swap functions.
