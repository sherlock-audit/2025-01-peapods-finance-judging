# `swapV3Single()` has the param `sqrtPriceLimitX96` set to zero, opening the door for sandwich attacks

### Summary

`swapV3Single()` basically tries to make a swap in a uni v3 pool with `sqrtPriceLimitX96` set to zero, which opens the door for sandwich attacks initiated by bots, which will cause the user to incur large losses

### Root Cause

The root cause is setting `sqrtPriceLimitX96` to zero in `swapV3Single()`, as this will make the function has no slippage limit.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Bot is configured to snipe that function and it is on a chain with a public mempool (such as Ethereum)

### Attack Path

1. User initiates a swap via `swapV3Single()` 
2. Bot snipes it with large amounts of funds, pushing the price 10% up
3. User will receive 10% less tokens, causing him a loss of 1/10th
4. Bot back runs to sell the tokens and profits from this

### Impact

Loss of funds when using `swapV3Single()` without any restrictions, just a bot with funds is needed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply some limit on the param -> `sqrtPriceLimitX96`
