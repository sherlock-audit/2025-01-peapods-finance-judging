# Update the price per block methodology is riskyin volatile situations

### Summary

Update the price per block methodology is riskyin volatile situations

### Root Cause

In [FraxlendPairCore contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L532C1-L550C10), exchange rate is only updated once per block. 

```solidity
        if (_exchangeRateInfo.lastTimestamp != block.timestamp) {
            // Get the latest exchange rate from the dual oracle
            bool _oneOracleBad;
            (_oneOracleBad, _lowExchangeRate, _highExchangeRate) = IDualOracle(_exchangeRateInfo.oracle).getPrices();

            // If one oracle is bad data, emit an event for off-chain monitoring
            if (_oneOracleBad) emit WarnOracleData(_exchangeRateInfo.oracle);

            // Effects: Bookkeeping and write to storage
            _exchangeRateInfo.lastTimestamp = uint184(block.timestamp);
            _exchangeRateInfo.lowExchangeRate = _lowExchangeRate;
            _exchangeRateInfo.highExchangeRate = _highExchangeRate;
            exchangeRateInfo = _exchangeRateInfo;
            emit UpdateExchangeRate(_lowExchangeRate, _highExchangeRate);
        } else {
            // Use default return values if already updated this block
            _lowExchangeRate = _exchangeRateInfo.lowExchangeRate;
            _highExchangeRate = _exchangeRateInfo.highExchangeRate;
        }
```

Liquidations can only be happened once LTV becomes greater than max LTV and the low exchange price is used for this calculation. 

This calculation will be risky because we know that Chainlink updates the price whenever the deviation of the price exceeds the threshold. Price can be updated multiple times in block by the Chainlink in big price drop scenarios.

But the fraxlend codebase doesn't allow to check the price again in the same block. It may delay the liquidation scenarios and it may cause bad debt due to price fluctation.



### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

1. Big price drops should happen

### Attack Path

1. At the beginning of the block an user depositted asset to the lending pair and the exchange rate is updated in this call
2. In the same block, a big price drop is happened and Chainlink is updated the aggregator's answer
3. The liquidation calls won't work because exchange rate can be updated once per block

### Impact

It will cause DoS for the positions which should be liquidated and also it may cause bad debt depends on the price drop.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow exchange rate update multiple times for one block
