# Removing leverage will be failed due to the rounding down in share calculation

### Summary

In `_acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment` function, some pod tokens are swapped to `borrowToken`.
In case of `_isPodSelfLending`, due to the share calculation with rounding down, removing leverage is failed with reverted flash loan.

### Root Cause

In [`_addLeveragePostCallback`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L435-L446) function, the share amount corresponding to `_borrowAmtNeededToSwap` is calculated with rounding down.
Therefore, the amount of `borrowToken` returned by `FraxlendPair.redeem` function may be smaller than `_borrowAmtNeededToSwap`.

```solidity
    function convertToShares(uint256 _assets) external view returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _shares = toAssetShares(_assets, false, true);
    }

    function toAssetShares(uint256 _amount, bool _roundUp, bool _previewInterest)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 _shares)
    {
        if (_previewInterest) {
            (,,,, VaultAccount memory _totalAsset,) = previewAddInterest();
            _shares = _totalAsset.toShares(_amount, _roundUp);
        } else {
            _shares = totalAsset.toShares(_amount, _roundUp);
        }
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_isPodSelfLending

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Removing leverage will be failed due the lack of `borrowToken` for flash loan.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In case of `_isPodSelfLending`, use rounding up in calculation of share amount.
