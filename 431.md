# `_removeLeveragePostCallback()` calls `repayAsset()` but hasn't given the fraxlend pair the necessary approval to complete the tx

### Summary

When removing the leverage, we would need to give the fraxlend pair approval, but as seen in the code, it is not given anywhere, thus making it impossible to actually remove the leverage, locking the user's funds forever.

### Root Cause

The root cause is a lack of approving the fraxlend pair when removing leverage via the specified function.

Even though it is said that prior to the flash loan, the assets are approved, nowhere can this be seen in the pre flashloan logic.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User has a leveraged position

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Bob creates a leverage position via `LeverageManager::addLeverage()` with 1 ETH
2. Bob then tries to redeem his 1 ETH back by removing the leverage and repaying, but due to no approval, the tx would revert [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L365) and cause stuck funds 

### Impact

Funds will be forever lost when a leveraged position is created, as we can't redeem it

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Give the fraxlend pair the necessary approval
