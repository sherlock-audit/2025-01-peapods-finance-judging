# Price Manipulation Vulnerability in `TokenRewards` Contract

### Summary

Missing price manipulation protection in `depositFromPairedLpToken` will cause excessive rewards to be minted for attackers as they will manipulate the pool price through flash loans to artificially increase their reward allocation.*Malicious actors will steal rewards from legitimate users through price manipulation*


### Root Cause

*In `TokenRewards.sol:depositFromPairedLpToken()` the reward calculation uses the current pool price without any manipulation protection:*

```solidity
function depositFromPairedLpToken(uint256 _amountTknDepositing) public override {
    uint160 _rewardsSqrtPriceX96 = V3_TWAP_UTILS.sqrtPriceX96FromPoolAndInterval(_pool);
    uint256 _rewardsPriceX96 = V3_TWAP_UTILS.priceX96FromSqrtPriceX96(_rewardsSqrtPriceX96);
    uint256 _amountOut = _token0 == PAIRED_LP_TOKEN
        ? (_rewardsPriceX96 * _amountTkn) / FixedPoint96.Q96
        : (_amountTkn * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _rewardsPriceX96;
}
```
[`TokenRewards.sol:depositFromPairedLpToken()`](https://github.com/peapods/contracts/blob/main/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L141-L146)

the vulnerabilities in its price calculation mechanism. First, it relies on the current spot price from the Uniswap V3 pool without implementing a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP). This makes it susceptible to price manipulation through large trades, as the spot price can be significantly moved within a single block. 

The price calculation also lacks any minimum timeframe requirement for the interval between price checks. An attacker can execute their entire attack within a single block, manipulating the price and claiming rewards before the price can stabilize. This is particularly dangerous as it allows for atomic flash loan attacks where the price is manipulated and exploited in the same transaction.
the contract has no protection against flash loan attacks. Without implementing checks for price impact or minimum holding periods, an attacker can borrow a large amount of tokens, manipulate the pool price, claim inflated rewards, and repay the loan all in a single atomic transaction. This makes the attack virtually risk-free for the attacker while causing significant damage to the protocol.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol have rewards available for distribution
2. `rewards token` price needs to be different from `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` price


### External Pre-conditions

1. Flash loan providers need to have sufficient liquidity
2. Pool needs to have enough liquidity to execute large swaps
3. Gas price needs to be low enough to make the attack profitable we have Arbitrum.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker takes a flash loan of a large amount of tokens
2. Executes a swap to manipulate the pool price significantly
3. Calls `depositFromPairedLpToken` with a small amount while the price is manipulated
4. Receives excessive rewards due to manipulated price calculation
5. Swaps rewards for original tokens and repays flash loan
6. Keeps profit from the excess rewards

### Impact

 users suffer dilution of their rewards as attackers can extract excessive rewards through price manipulation. For example, if an attacker manipulates the price by 2x through a flash loan, they can extract twice the normal rewards for their deposit amount. This directly reduces the rewards available for legitimate users and can lead to significant protocol fund loss over time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Implement mandatory TWAP for price calculations with a minimum timeframe
2. Add price impact checks to prevent large price manipulations
3. Implement flash loan protection through minimum holding periods
