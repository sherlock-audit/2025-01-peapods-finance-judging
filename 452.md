# FraxlendPair interest is linearly updated, causing the interest to vary significantly due to the update frequency.


### Summary

FraxlendPair interest is linearly updated, causing the interest to vary significantly due to the update frequency.

### Root Cause

Fraxlend uses linear interest calculation, which means interest is calculated by interest rate by the time delta. This can lead to different interest amounts, depending on how frequently itâ€™s called. A higher frequency of interest update would lead to higher total interest.

The linear interest formula in a year is `finalInterest = (1 + rate * x / 365) ** (365 / x)`.

- If we assume 80% APY and interest is updated daily, plug in `rate=0.8, x=1`, we would get `finalInterest=2.2236`.
- If we assume interest is updated monthly, plug in `rate=0.8, x=30`, we get `finalInterest=2.1701`.

This is an annual interest diff of ~0.05%.
