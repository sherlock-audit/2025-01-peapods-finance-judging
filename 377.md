# Incorrect check in set partner fee function

### Summary

Incorrect check in set partner fee function

### Root Cause

In [Decentralized Index contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L443C1-L447C6), set partner fee function is incorrectly checking the maximum partner fee amount. It checks the current value instead.

```solidity
    function setPartnerFee(uint16 _fee) external onlyPartner {
        require(_fee < _fees.partner, "L"); 
        _fees.partner = _fee;
        emit SetPartnerFee(_msgSender(), _fee);
    }
```

Normally, maximum fee for partner is choosen as following value:

```solidity
        require(__fees.partner <= (uint256(DEN) * 5) / 100);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

No condition

### External Pre-conditions

No condition

### Attack Path

Let say partner wants to reduce the fee from 4% level to 3%. After this change, he can't update this value back to 4% due to incorrect check. 


### Impact

Partner can't increase the fee back to desired point after reducing it. Normally, it should check the max value for the partner but instead it checks the previous value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead check the new partner fee is lower than 5% max value.
