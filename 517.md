# Improper Handling of Paused Tokens in `TokenRewards._resetExcluded()` Function

## Summary
The function `_resetExcluded` in `TokenRewards` contract does not properly handle tokens that have been paused in the `REWARDS_WHITELISTER`. As a result, the excluded rewards for paused tokens may still be updated, which can lead to inconsistent or incorrect reward calculations for stakers.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_resetExcluded` function, there is a loop that iterates over all rewards tokens. Inside the loop, the function checks if each reward token has been paused by the `REWARDS_WHITELISTER`. However, the logic fails to take into account the paused state of tokens. Specifically, the `REWARDS_WHITELISTER.paused(_token)` check is not used to skip the update of the excluded rewards for tokens that are paused.

Here is the problematic code:

```solidity
for (uint256 _i; _i < _allRewardsTokens.length; _i++) {
@>  address _token = _allRewardsTokens[_i]; // @audit REWARDS_WHITELISTER paused not considered
    rewards[_token][_wallet].excluded = _cumulativeRewards(_token, shares[_wallet], true);
}
```

In this loop, the function attempts to update the excluded rewards for each token, but it does not consider whether the token has been paused. If a token is paused, the excluded reward calculation should be skipped to avoid improper reward distribution.

## Impact
-	Inaccurate reward distribution: If paused tokens are not properly handled, users could receive incorrect reward amounts, either by having their excluded rewards incorrectly updated or by missing out on rewards for paused tokens while performing [`setShares()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L97).

## Tool used 
Manual Review

## Recommendation
-	Add the check for paused tokens in the loop to prevent updating rewards for paused tokens.
-	Modify the _resetExcluded function to respect the paused state of tokens as follows:
```diff
for (uint256 _i; _i < _allRewardsTokens.length; _i++) {
    address _token = _allRewardsTokens[_i];
+   if (REWARDS_WHITELISTER.paused(_token)) {
+       continue;  // Skip paused tokens
+   }
    rewards[_token][_wallet].excluded = _cumulativeRewards(_token, shares[_wallet], true);
}
```
