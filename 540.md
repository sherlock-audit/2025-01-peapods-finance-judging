# wrong calculation when converting the fee amount into share

### Summary

In the contract **FraxlendPairCore**, in the function **_calculateInterest** on line 424, when calculating **_results.feesShare**, we are using the total assets of both the internal and external assets:
```solidity
_results.feesShare = (_results.feesAmount * _results.totalAsset.shares)
                        / (_results.totalAsset.totalAmount(address(0)) - _results.feesAmount);
```
By passing the address zero to _results.totalAsset.totalAmount(address(0)), we are including both the internal asset and the external vault to convert the fee amount into shares. However, the issue arises because most of the deposit functions use VaultAccount.toShares to calculate shares, and this function only utilizes the internal assets:
```solidity
if (total.amount == 0) {
    shares = amount;
} else {
    shares = (amount * total.shares) / total.amount;
    if (roundUp && (shares * total.amount) / total.shares < amount) {
        shares = shares + 1;
    }
}
```
As a result of these two different calculations for shares, **_results.feesShare** is calculated incorrectly.

### Root Cause

in **FraxlendPairCore**  line 425  we are dividing  it with both the external and internal asset amount to calculate the share instead of only the internal  

### Internal Pre-conditions

nothing 

### External Pre-conditions

nothing

### Attack Path

nothing 

### Impact

loss of fund for the  protocol as it is receiving a small amount of share due to the wrong calculation
