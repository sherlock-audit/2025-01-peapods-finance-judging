# Missing fee validation allows Flash Loan exploit

### **Summary**
The missing validation check in `BalancerFlashSource.sol:receiveFlashLoan()` will cause financial losses for the protocol as an attacker will manipulate `_feeAmounts[0]`, allowing them to take flash loans without paying the required fee.

---

### **Root Cause**
In [`BalancerFlashSource.sol:receiveFlashLoan()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/flash/BalancerFlashSource.sol#L47C4-L57C6), the function assigns `_feeAmounts[0]` directly to `_fData.fee` **without verifying if the contract actually received the required fee**.  
- **Vulnerable Code:**  
  ```solidity
  _fData.fee = _feeAmounts[0];
  ```
- The contract assumes `_feeAmounts[0]` is correct but does not verify the actual balance changes.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**
1. **Attacker controls `_userData`** and can modify input parameters.  
2. **The contract relies on `_feeAmounts[0]` as a trusted value** but does not validate it.  
3. **No validation exists to check the contract’s balance before and after the transaction.**  

---

### **Attack Path**
1. **Attacker calls `flashLoan()`** with a manipulated `_userData`, setting `_feeAmounts[0]` to `0`.  
2. The contract **accepts `_feeAmounts[0]` without verification** and assigns it to `_fData.fee`.  
3. The attacker **receives the flash loan but avoids paying the required fee**.  
4. The attacker **repeats the attack multiple times**, extracting funds and depleting protocol revenue.  

---

### **Impact**
- **Affected Party:** The protocol and liquidity providers.  
- **Loss Type:** Financial loss due to **fee evasion**.  
- **Protocol Revenue Loss:** The flash loan system relies on collecting fees, and fee evasion directly reduces sustainability.  
  - **Potential Insolvency Risk:** If exploited repeatedly, the protocol may become unprofitable and fail to cover operational costs.  
  - **Flash Loan Abuse:** Attackers can borrow flash loans at zero cost, leading to potential market manipulation and arbitrage abuse.  
  - **Reputational Damage:** If publicly exploited, users may lose trust in the protocol’s security and reliability.

    struct FlashData {

        // Malicious payload to bypass fee validation
        FlashData memory fData = FlashData(address(this), address(targetToken), _loanAmount, "", 0);
        bytes memory maliciousData = abi.encode(fData);

        IERC20;
        tokens[0] = targetToken;
        
        uint256;
        amounts[0] = _loanAmount;

        // Requesting a flash loan with manipulated fee
        flashLoanSource.flashLoan(address(this), tokens, amounts, maliciousData);
    }

    function callback(bytes calldata _userData) external override {
        FlashData memory fData = abi.decode(_userData, (FlashData));

        // Manipulate fee amount to 0
        uint256 fakeFee = 0;

        // Transfer loan amount to attacker
        IERC20(fData.token).safeTransfer(attacker, fData.amount);

        // Repay loan with manipulated fee (zero)
        IERC20(fData.token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, fData.amount + fakeFee);
    }
}
```

1. **Executing the Attack:**  
   - The attacker calls `executeAttack()` with a desired loan amount.  
   - A flash loan request is sent with manipulated data (`fee = 0`).  
2.  **Loan Transfer Without Fee Validation:**  
   - The protocol processes the flash loan and transfers the loan amount.  
   - The value of `_feeAmounts[0]` is accepted without verification, and `fee = 0` is stored.  
3. **Fee Manipulation in `callback()`:**  
   - The flash loan contract executes the `callback()` function on the recipient.  
   - The attacker sets `fee` to zero, deceiving the system.  
4. **Receiving the Loan at No Cost:**  
   - The attacker transfers the loan amount to their own account.  
   - The initial loan amount is repaid to the contract without any fee.  
5.  **Repeating the Attack & Financial Losses:**  
   - The attacker repeats this process multiple times, taking free loans.  
   - The protocol suffers financial losses, reduced liquidity, and potential insolvency.

### **Mitigation**
**Verify the contract balance before and after the transaction to confirm fee deduction:**  
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_fData.token).balanceOf(address(this));

// Transfer flash loan amount
IERC20(_fData.token).safeTransfer(_fData.recipient, _fData.amount);

// Check that the required fee has been received
uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_fData.token).balanceOf(address(this));
require(balanceAfter >= balanceBefore + _fData.fee, "Fee mismatch");
```
 **Ensure `_feeAmounts[0]` is validated before being assigned.**  
 **Enforce fee checks at the smart contract level, preventing manipulation.**  
 **Implement a mechanism to track actual received fees instead of trusting external input.**  

---

### **Conclusion**
This vulnerability exposes the protocol to **repeated financial losses and possible insolvency** due to flash loan fee evasion. Immediate remediation is necessary to secure the system and protect protocol revenue.
