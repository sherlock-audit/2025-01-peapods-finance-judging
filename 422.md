# Users sending type(uint256).max transfers will cause accounting discrepancies due to custom token behavior

### Summary

The ability to pass type(uint256).max as transfer amounts will cause accounting discrepancies in core protocol functions due to tokens like cUSDCv3 having custom behavior where type(uint256).max transfers the user's entire balance instead of the expected amount. This will lead to protocol accounting mismatches and incorrect share/asset ratios across multiple critical contracts.

### Root Cause

Multiple critical protocol components are vulnerable to accounting discrepancies due to lack of validation against type(uint256).max token transfers in key functions:

1. In `StakingPoolToken.sol:67` the stake() function lacks validation: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/StakingPoolToken.sol#L67-L67
```solidity
function stake(address _user, uint256 _amount) external override {
    require(stakingToken != address(0), "I");
    _mint(_user, _amount); // Mints shares based on type(uint256).max
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
}
```

  StakingPoolToken is explicitly highlighted as a core protocol component that "custodies a lot of funds". The mismatch between expected and actual transfer amounts could lead to incorrect share minting and permanent vault accounting issues.

2. In `LeverageManager.sol:81` the addLeverage() function: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L81-L81
```solidity
function addLeverage(
    uint256 _positionId,
    address _pod,
    uint256 _pTknAmt,
    uint256 _pairedLpDesired,
    uint256 _userProvidedDebtAmt,
    bool _hasSelfLendingPairPod,
    bytes memory _config
) external override workflow(true) {
    IERC20(_pod).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _pTknAmt);
}
```

The team specifically calls out addLeverage() as a critical entry point that must be "very secure". Any accounting discrepancies here could cause leveraged positions to be incorrectly sized, potentially leading to  incorrect liquidation thresholds.

3. In `DecentralizedIndex.sol:378` removeLiquidityV2(): https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L378-L378
```solidity
function removeLiquidityV2(
    uint256 _lpTokens,
    uint256 _minIdxTokens,
    uint256 _minPairedLpToken,
    uint256 _deadline
) external override lock noSwapOrFee {
    IERC20(V2_POOL).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _lpTokens);
}
```

Incorrect liquidity removal amounts could destabilize pool ratios and affect the entire protocol's pricing.

4. In `TokenRewards.sol:141` depositFromPairedLpToken(): https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L141-L141
```solidity
function depositFromPairedLpToken(uint256 _amountTknDepositing) public override {
    IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amountTknDepositing);
}
```

This affects the protocol's reward distribution system. Incorrect deposit amounts could lead to unfair reward distributions and permanently misaligned incentive structures.

5. In `LendingAssetVault.sol:162` deposit: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L162-L162   
```solidity
function _deposit(uint256 _assets, uint256 _shares, address _receiver) internal {
    require(_assets != 0 && _shares != 0, "M");
    _totalAssets += _assets;
    _mint(_receiver, _shares);
    IERC20(_asset).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _assets);
}
```

The vault's Collateral Backing Ratio (CBR), which is specifically called out as a critical invariant that "should always increase and never decrease" except in cases of bad debt. Accounting mismatches here could permanently break this core protocol invariant.

The severity is amplified because:
1. These vulnerabilities exist in contracts explicitly identified as critical by the team
2. They affect core protocol functionality around asset custody and accounting
3. While the protocol has whitelisting for rewards tokens, other token integration paths need to be carefully examined to determine potential exposure to tokens with custom type(uint256).max behavior.
4. Impact could lead to material loss of funds through incorrect accounting and broken protocol invariants

Each of these instances could lead to permanent accounting mismatches between expected and actual token balances, potentially compromising the entire protocol's integrity.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A token with custom type(uint256).max transfer behavior (like cUSDCv3) must be used in the protocol
2. User must have a non-zero balance of the token
3. The affected functions must be called with type(uint256).max as the transfer amount

### External Pre-conditions

None


### Attack Path

1. User calls any of the vulnerable functions (e.g. stake(), addLeverage()) with amount = type(uint256).max
2. Token's transfer function detects max uint and instead transfers user's entire balance
3. Protocol records type(uint256).max as the transferred amount
4. Protocol calculates shares/positions based on type(uint256).max
5. Actual transferred amount is less than recorded amount
6. Protocol accounting becomes mismatched with actual token balances

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect accounting across multiple critical systems:

1. Incorrect share minting in ERC4626 vaults
2. Wrong leverage position calculations 
3. Inaccurate liquidity tracking
4. Mismatched reward distributions

This puts user funds at risk as:
- Share prices could be manipulated 
- Leverage positions could be incorrectly sized
- Reward distributions could be uneven
- Vault accounting could become permanently misaligned

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add validation to prevent type(uint256).max transfers:

```solidity
function stake(address _user, uint256 _amount) external override {
    require(_amount != type(uint256).max, "Invalid amount");
    require(stakingToken != address(0), "I");
    if (stakeUserRestriction != address(0)) {
        require(_user == stakeUserRestriction, "U");
    }
    _mint(_user, _amount);
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
    emit Stake(_msgSender(), _user, _amount);
}
```

Add similar checks to all functions that accept token transfer amounts.
