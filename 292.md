# DoS in `LeverageManager::addLeverageFromTkn` when target Pod has multiple index tokens

## Root Cause

There is no logic in place to handle multiple pod index tokens when calling `LeverageManager::addLeverageFromTkn`.

## Vulnerability Details 

The `addLeverageFromTkn` function adds leverage to an existing position (or creates a new one and adds leverage) using the underlying pod’s TKN. Initially, it calls `_bondToPod` to bond the TKN to pTKN on behalf of the user.  
[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L571-L573) we can see that only the first index token is transferred from the user to the LeverageManager contract. However, if there are multiple `_podAssets`, the [following bond operation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L576) will revert because the LeverageManager does not receive the corresponding token’s value from the user.

## Impact

DoS in LeverageManager::addLeverageFromTkn when target Pod has multiple index tokens

## Recommended mitigation

When there are multiple `_podAssets`, in the `_bondToPod` function we need to use [`WeightedIndex::getInitialAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L204) to transfer the correct amount of token value from user to LeverageManager contract.
