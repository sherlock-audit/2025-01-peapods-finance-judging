# Centralized tokens with blacklist or pause functions will prevent users from withdrawing any funds

### Summary

Centralized tokens may result in users being unable to withdraw funds.

### Root Cause

In [PodUnwarpLocker._withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/PodUnwrapLocker.sol#L148-L163) , tokens in `lock.tokens` are iterated through. If any token is paused or the user is blacklisted, fund withdrawals will be blocked, leading to potential financial loss.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Centralized tokens such as USDC or USDT may be paused or blacklist users.

### Attack Path

When a user calls `debondAndLock`, the user needs to send pToken to the PodUnwrapLocker, where the contract locks the user's funds for a period. After some time, the user can call the `withdraw` function to retrieve the funds. However, if the user is blacklisted or the token is paused, the user cannot withdraw the token, resulting in a revert. The user also cannot trade the pToken with others (as it has already been sent to PodUnwrapLocker and debonded), causing the loss of all funds.

### Impact

User can't claim any rewards.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Fix the logic
