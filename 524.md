# ERC20 transfer fee handling

**Description:**  
The protocol does not handle tokens with transfer fees (fee-on-transfer tokens). This can lead to discrepancies in token balances, causing the contract to malfunction during operations such as swaps, deposits, or withdrawals. The absence of proper handling for these tokens is a critical vulnerability, especially since fee-on-transfer tokens are common in DeFi ecosystems.

**Impact:**  
- Transactions involving fee-on-transfer tokens may fail or result in incorrect balances.
- Potential loss of funds due to unaccounted-for fees during transfers.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement a mechanism to account for fee-on-transfer tokens. For example:
- Use `safeTransferFrom` followed by balance checks to ensure the correct amount is received.
- Add a whitelist for supported tokens and explicitly exclude fee-on-transfer tokens.

**Code Reference:**  
```solidity
IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
```
