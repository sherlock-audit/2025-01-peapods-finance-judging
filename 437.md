# During the call to `debond()`, someone can frontrun us making us not the last out

### Summary

During debonding as we have no slippage param and we are the last, we will suppose that we can debond our pod token without any fee due to the `__isLastOut()` being true.

Someone can see that and snipe us, depositing just a small amount of pod token via `bond()` and frontrunning us so we get unexpectedly taxed when calling `debond()`

### Root Cause

The root cause is a lack of a slippage param in `debond()`, causing the user to incur an unexpected loss if he is the last one and someone snipes him.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User should be the last one holding his bond tokens when calling `debond()`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Bob is the last one with the pod token and calls `debond()` knowing that he won't get any fees on his pod tokens when redeeming
2. Malicious Alice sees that and frontruns him with a call to `bond()` to mint just enough pod tokens so that Bob won't be exempt from the usual fee
3. Bob is unexpectedly forced to pay the fee due to Alice's actions, causing loss of funds and Alice getting instant rewards

### Impact

Unexpectedly losing funds when user is the last one to debond due to no slippage param

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a slippage param in `debond()`
