# Token bridge burns incorrect amount when bridging fee-on-transfer tokens

### Summary

[_processInboundTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/ccip/TokenBridge.sol#L96-L107) will burn the pre-transfer amount instead of the post-transfer amount when bridging fee-on-transfer tokens, leading to an incorrect burn amount that doesn't match the actual tokens received.


### Root Cause

In [TokenBridge.sol:104](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/ccip/TokenBridge.sol#L104) the gross `_amount` is used instead of `_amountAfter` which nets out any fees.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `sourceTokenMintBurn` must be set to be true on the config



### External Pre-conditions

1. ERC20 token needs to implement a fee mechanism that reduces the received amount compared to the transfer amount
2. ERC20 token needs to be approved by the user to the bridge contract for at least the desired transfer amount

### Attack Path

1. User attempts to bridge 1000 tokens with a 2% transfer fee
2. Bridge contract receives 980 tokens due to the fee
3. Bridge contract burns 1000 tokens instead of 980
4. Destination chain mints based on the _amountAfter (980)
5. The total supply decreases by more than the actual bridged amount

### Impact

The protocol will burn more tokens than were actually bridged, permanently reducing the token supply by the difference between pre and post transfer amounts. This affects token economics and can lead to supply inconsistencies between chains.
For a token with a 2% transfer fee:

- User transfers 1000 tokens
- Bridge receives 980 tokens
- Bridge burns 1000 tokens
- Destination mints 980 tokens
- Net result: 20 tokens permanently removed from supply

The percentage loss scales with the transfer fee amount and total bridged amount. While individual transactions may have small impacts, the cumulative effect across many transactions could be significant.

### PoC

```solidity
contract TestFeeToken is IERC20Bridgeable {
    uint256 public constant FEE = 20; // 2% fee
    
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        uint256 feeAmount = (amount * FEE) / 1000;
        uint256 actualTransfer = amount - feeAmount;
        // Transfer actualTransfer amount to recipient
        return true;
    }
}

function testBridgeFeeToken() public {
    TestFeeToken token = new TestFeeToken();
    uint256 initialSupply = token.totalSupply();
    
    bridge._processInboundTokens(address(token), user, 1000, true);
    
    // Bridge received 980 tokens but burned 1000
    assertEq(token.totalSupply(), initialSupply - 1000); // Should be initialSupply - 980
}
```

### Mitigation

The burn amount should match the actual received amount that will be bridged. Update the burning logic to use the calculated `_amountAfter` value:

```diff
if (_isMintBurn) {
-   IERC20Bridgeable(_token).burn(_amount);
+   IERC20Bridgeable(_token).burn(_amountAfter);
}
return _amountAfter;
```
