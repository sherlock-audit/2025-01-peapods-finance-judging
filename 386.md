# `spTKNMinimalOracle.sol` counts debond fee twice, which will make the end price (spTKN per base) higher than it should be

### Summary


The `spTKNMinimalOracle::_calculateBasePerPTkn` will count unwrap fee twice, which will make the base per PTkn price lower than what it should be. Eventually the base per PTkn price will be reversed and calculated into spTKN per base price, which will be higher than what it should be.
This inflated price of spTKN can be used to calculate the aspTkn price and in the fraxlend to determine solvency and also in the liquidation process. As the result the liquidator might get more than what they should get.


### Root Cause

`spTKNMinimalOracle::_calculateBasePerPTkn` calculates the PTkn price based on the Tkn price. When it converts from Tkn price to pTkn price, it accounts for CBR and then account for unwrap fee:

However, the `_accountForCBRInPrice` uses `WeightedIndex::convertToAssets`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L243

The `WeightedIndex::convertToAssets` already subtracts the debond fee from the assets returned:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L120-L130

This PTkn price from `convertToAssets` will be accounted for the unwrap fee using `_accountForUnwrapFeeInPrice` which will subtract the debond fee once more:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L246-L253

Also, if the base is pod, it uses `_checkAndHandleBaseTokenPodConfig`, which will as well use these two functions `_accountForCBRInPrice` and `_accountForUnwrapFeeInPrice`. Therefore it will as well count the debond fee twice.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Either (does not need to be both)
- `DEBOND_FEE` of the WeightedIndex is set to non-zero
- or the `BASE_IS_POD` and the base has debond fee


### External Pre-conditions

- The `aspTKNMinimalOracle.sol` which inherits from `spTKNMinimalOracle.sol`, is used in the Fraxlend pair to determine the price of `aspTKN` per `borrowTkn`.


### Attack Path

1. liquidator liquidates


### Impact

The price of spTKN per base will calculated higher than it should be. If this incorrect price is used in Fraxlend pair, this incorrect price may be used to determine solvency and the amount of collateral for liquidator:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L232

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1135-L1136

For the solvency, it is result in effectively higher `maxLTV`, so it is less problematic.
But for the calculation of collateral amounts for liquidator, the liquidator may get more collateral than they should get.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider dropping the `_accountForUnwrapFeeInPrice`
