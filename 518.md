# Incorrect withdraw fee is calculated for the owner

### Summary

Incorrect withdraw fee is calculated for the owner

### Root Cause

In [FraxlendPair contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L452), withdraw fee function doesn't update the accrued interest and it will get less amount of fee from the contract. 

```solidity
    function withdrawFees(uint128 _shares, address _recipient) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 _amountToTransfer) {
        if (_recipient == address(0)) revert InvalidReceiver();

&>     // @audit _addInterest is needed here

        // Grab some data from state to save gas
        VaultAccount memory _totalAsset = totalAsset;

        // Take all available if 0 value passed
        if (_shares == 0) _shares = balanceOf(address(this)).toUint128();

        // We must calculate this before we subtract from _totalAsset or invoke _burn
        _amountToTransfer = _totalAsset.toAmount(_shares, true);

        _approve(address(this), msg.sender, _shares);
        _redeem(_totalAsset, _amountToTransfer.toUint128(), _shares, _recipient, address(this), false);
        uint256 _collateralAmount = userCollateralBalance[address(this)];
        _removeCollateral(_collateralAmount, _recipient, address(this));
        emit WithdrawFees(_shares, _recipient, _amountToTransfer, _collateralAmount);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

No need

### Impact

Owner will get less amount of asset after withdrawing the fee, it's loss of funds for the protocol. The loss depends on the usage ratio of the contract. If withdraw fee is called after long time ago ( contract didn't get any action for a while ), the loss will be higher than expected.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply the interest before calculation.
