# `depositFromPairedLpToken` fees are aplied one on another

### Summary

When applying the fees `depositFromPairedLpToken` applies admin and yield fees:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L148-L162
```solidity
        uint256 _adminAmt = _getAdminFeeFromAmount(_amountTkn);
        _amountTkn -= _adminAmt;

        if (LEAVE_AS_PAIRED_LP_TOKEN) {
            (, uint256 _yieldBurnFee) = _getYieldFees();

            uint256 _burnAmount = (_amountTkn * _yieldBurnFee) / PROTOCOL_FEE_ROUTER.protocolFees().DEN();
            _adminAmt += _burnAmount;
            _amountTkn -= _burnAmount;

            if (_adminAmt > 0) {
                _processAdminFee(_adminAmt);
            }

            _depositRewards(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN, _amountTkn);
            return;
        }
```

However due to the order they are applied the yield fee is proportionality reduced by the admin fee, resulting in lower yield fee, thus lower burn amount.

### Root Cause

Applying yield fee on the already lowered amount (by the admin fee)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L148-L162
```solidity
        uint256 _adminAmt = _getAdminFeeFromAmount(_amountTkn);
        _amountTkn -= _adminAmt; // amount is lowered by admin fee

        if (LEAVE_AS_PAIRED_LP_TOKEN) {
            (, uint256 _yieldBurnFee) = _getYieldFees();

            // yield fee applied on the already lowered amount
            uint256 _burnAmount = (_amountTkn * _yieldBurnFee) / PROTOCOL_FEE_ROUTER.protocolFees().DEN();
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
1. Both fees are 10%
2. Deposit of 1000 tokens is made
3. `_amountTkn` is reduced by 10% to 900
4. yield fee is calculated as 10% out of 900, which is 90

Total fees are 190 (19%), even thought they are 10% each -> 20% total
Yield fee is 10% lower due to the sequential fee.

### Impact

Yield fee is proportionality lower, due to using the already lowered amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply the yield fee on the full amount, then decrease it by both fees.
