# Transferring of _userProvidedDebtAmtMax does not work in _acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment because _props.sender is never set, which leads to a transferFrom call from address(0), causing the transaction to revert

### Summary

In `_acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment`, a user can specify how many tokens they are willing to provide using `_userProvidedDebtAmtMax` if there are not enough tokens to repay the flash loan. However, this does not work because the transfer is attempted from `_props.sender`, which was never set. As a result, `removeLeverage`, which relies on this function, reverts.

### Root Cause

`removeLeverage` in the `LeverageManager` uses `_acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment` to obtain tokens for repaying the flash loan if there are currently not enough. Here, a user can specify a maximum amount they are willing to provide:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L423-L430
Here, you can see that the amount the user is willing to provide is transferred from `_props.sender`. The problem is that `_props.sender` is never set. Only `_props.owner` is set at the beginning of the `removeLeverage` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L177-L180
This causes `_props.sender` in `_acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment` to be `address(0)`, which leads to the transfer reverting since nothing can be transferred from `address(0)`.

It is also important to note that there is another way to acquire the borrow tokens, but it does not always work, as I explained in Issue "Swapping in _acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment is not working when the sell fee is enabled because the swap does not support fee-on-transfer tokens". This makes this issue even more critical.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No preconditions, this feature does not work regardless of how the protocol is configured.

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice bonds PEAS tokens
2. With the received pTKNs, Alice calls `addLeverage`
3. Alice wants to call removeLeverage and provides a `_userProvidedDebtAmtMax`. The call reverts because the transfer fails

### Impact

A feature of the protocol is not working, which prevents users from providing a portion of the repayment amount for the flash loan themselves. This can lead to users being unable to remove their leverage, especially if the swap doesn't work, for example, due to slippage or the other issue I mentioned above.
