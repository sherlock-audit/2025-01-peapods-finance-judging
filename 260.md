# Incorrect price calculation in `getPodPerBasePrice()` when paired asset is a Fraxlend pair or Pod

### Summary

A missing price conversion in `getPodPerBasePrice()` will cause an incorrect price calculation for the affected party (`AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract and any external integrations relying on this price feed) as anyone querying the oracle will receive a price that doesn't account for the conversion between the underlying token and the Fraxlend pair/pod token as the real paired asset.

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the discrepancy between the required pricing logic and the implementation in `getPodPerBasePrice()`. The provided documentation ([aspTKN Oracle - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-T_07QpJlqXlbBSiC_YverKFfu-gcSkOBzU1icMRkM/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.s5tvb0tbnsvq)) explicitly states: "We need pTKN priced in the PairedAsset of the pod."  It further clarifies that while the debt token and the paired asset are typically the same, in the case of self-lending pods, "pTKN needs to be denominated in fPairedAsset (frax supply receipt including interest)."

The current implementation of `getPodPerBasePrice()` calculates the price of pTKN in terms of the underlying asset via [`_calculateBasePerPTkn()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L170) and then inverts it. This function, shown below, retrieves the underlying price:

```solidity
function _calculateBasePerPTkn(uint256 _price18) internal view returns (uint256 _basePerPTkn18) {
        // pull from UniV3 TWAP if passed as 0
        if (_price18 == 0) {
            bool _isBadData;
            (_isBadData, _price18) = _getDefaultPrice18();
            if (_isBadData) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        _basePerPTkn18 = _accountForCBRInPrice(pod, underlyingTkn, _price18);

        // adjust current price for spTKN pod unwrap fee, which will end up making the end price
        // (spTKN per base) higher, meaning it will take more spTKN to equal the value
        // of base token. This will more accurately ensure healthy LTVs when lending since
        // a liquidation path will need to account for unwrap fees
        _basePerPTkn18 = _accountForUnwrapFeeInPrice(pod, _basePerPTkn18);
    }
```

However, it does *not* perform the necessary conversion to express the price in terms of the paired asset (e.g., fDAI) when the paired asset is a Fraxlend pair (fPairedAsset) or another pod (pPairedAsset).  For instance, in the case of pDAI (where the underlying is DAI and the paired asset is fDAI), `_calculateBasePerPTkn()` calculates the DAI/pTKN price. While this is then inverted in `getPodPerBasePrice()` to get pTKN/DAI, the crucial conversion from pTKN/DAI to pTKN/fDAI is missing.  This leads to an incorrect price being returned.  The code for [`getPodPerBasePrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L104) is shown below:

```solidity
function getPodPerBasePrice() external view override returns (uint256 _pricePTknPerBase18) {
    _pricePTknPerBase18 = 10 ** (18 * 2) / _calculateBasePerPTkn(0);
}
```

This missing conversion step is the root cause of the incorrect price calculation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `BASE_IS_POD` or `BASE_IS_FRAX_PAIR` is true.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A user interacts with the `AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract or an external integration that relies on the `spTKNMinimalOracle`.
2. The contract calls `getPodPerBasePrice()` to obtain the price of the pod in terms of the base asset.
3. The function returns an incorrect price because it doesn't account for the conversion between the underlying token and the Fraxlend pair/pod token.

### Impact

The incorrect price returned by `getPodPerBasePrice()` can have several significant impacts:

* The `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` function in `AutoCompoundingPodLp` uses this price to calculate swap amounts. An incorrect price will lead to inaccurate swap calculations, potentially causing the contract to receive less/more pod LP tokens than expected.
* External integrations relying on this price feed will also be affected. This could create vulnerabilities in other protocols that depend on accurate price data.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Implement the necessary conversion logic in `getPodPerBasePrice()` by checking the `BASE_IS_POD` and `BASE_IS_FRAX_PAIR` flags and applying the appropriate conversion. This logic is already present in the `_calculateSpTknPerBase()` function.
