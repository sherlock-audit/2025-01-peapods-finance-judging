# Protocol Implementation Deviates from ERC4626 Standard Requirements

### Summary

The protocol's vault implementations deviate from the **ERC4626 standard requirements**, which could lead to **unexpected behavior** when other protocols integrate with these vaults. While the protocol documentation claims ERC4626 compliance, several key standard requirements are not properly implemented.

### Root Cause

The ERC4626 standard requires specific implementations, but the protocol implements them differently:

1. In `LendingAssetVault.sol`:
```solidity
function convertToShares(uint256 _assets) public view override returns (uint256 _shares) {
    _shares = (_assets * PRECISION) / _cbr();
}
```
**ERC4626 Requirement**: "convertToShares MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller"
**Protocol Implementation**: The function uses `_cbr()` which can vary between calls, potentially causing inconsistent share calculations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

no

### External Pre-conditions

no

### Attack Path

no

### Impact

Other protocols integrating with these vaults may experience unexpected behavior,platforms built for ERC4626 vaults may not work correctly, The implementation does not fulfill the guarantees required by ERC4626

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Align implementation with ERC4626 requirements
