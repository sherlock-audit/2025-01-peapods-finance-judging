# User will have tokens stuck closing a leverage position due to an unconsidered case

### Summary

User will have tokens stuck closing a leverage position due to an unconsidered case

### Root Cause

Upon removing leverage, we have the following line:
```solidity
_borrowAmtRemaining = _pairedAmtReceived > _repayAmount ? _pairedAmtReceived - _repayAmount : 0;
```
This is how the remaining borrow tokens are calculated and are then refunded to the position owner. The issue is that the assumption of a 0 token refund when `_pairedAmtReceived` is <= `_repayAmount` is incorrect and will cause stuck funds in a certain case when the user overrides the target borrow tokens needed to reach the repayment amount.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. We go through most of the flow of removing leverage and we reach this piece of code:
```solidity
 if (_pairedAmtReceived < _repayAmount) {
            _podAmtRemaining = _acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment(_props, _posProps.pod, _d.token, _repayAmount - _pairedAmtReceived, _podAmtReceived, _podSwapAmtOutMin, _userProvidedDebtAmtMax);
}
```
2. This is a scenario where the borrowed token received (assuming the most simple and typical scenario where the borrowed/flashloaned token is the paired token) are less than the amount we have to repay, we all `_acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment()` with the borrow tokens needed equal to `_repayAmount - _pairedAmtReceived` which is essentially the tokens we need to receive to reach `_repayAmount`, __VERY IMPORTANT to note__ that users can provide `_podSwapAmtOutMin` which is the borrow tokens they want to receive for the swap
3. Upon calling the function mentioned above, we assume that the user hasn't provided any borrow tokens on his own and since we are in a normal pod scenario as mentioned in step 2, we just go to this code:
```solidity
_podAmtRemaining = _swapPodForBorrowToken(_pod, _borrowToken, _podAmtReceived, _borrowAmtNeededToSwap, _podSwapAmtOutMin);
```
4. We want to swap from `_pod` to the `_borrowToken`, swap at most `_podAmtReceived`, we need `_borrowAmtNeededToSwap` to reach the repayment amount and as noted in step 2, the user has provided `_podSwapAmtOutMin` which is the borrow tokens he wants to receive
5. There, we have the following swap:
```solidity
IERC20(_pod).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(_dexAdapter), _podAmt);
        _dexAdapter.swapV2SingleExactOut(_pod, _targetToken, _podAmt, _podSwapAmtOutMin == 0 ? _targetNeededAmt : _podSwapAmtOutMin, address(this));
```
6. If the user has provided `_podSwapAmtOutMin`, we override the actually needed borrow tokens for the repayment, the user provides his own which can be more than the target, let's assume we need 100 tokens but the user wants to swap more pod tokens and instead wants to receive 120 borrow tokens
7. The swap goes through, the pod tokens are swapped and we receive 120 tokens in return which is 20 more tokens that the amount needed for the repayment, this means that due to the code below, we will refund the user 0 tokens even though he is supposed to get 20 tokens as he got 20 more than the required repayment during the swap:
```solidity
_borrowAmtRemaining = _pairedAmtReceived > _repayAmount ? _pairedAmtReceived - _repayAmount : 0;
```
8. This is a direct loss of funds of 20 tokens for the user as he is refunded nothing

### Impact

Direct loss of funds for the user, the tokens will be stuck.

NOTE: There is a function to rescue tokens but due to the arbitrary inputs in the function for adding leverage, they can be stolen. The arbitrary inputs do not usually allow an exploit as there should be no tokens in the contract, however due to the bug here, a malicious actor can steal them before they are rescued, causing a non-recoverable loss of funds for the user, hence the __HIGH__ severity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Factor in the scenario where the swap yields more tokens than required
