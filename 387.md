# `aspTKNMinimalOracle.sol` uses stale `convertToShares`, likely overestimate the aspTKN per base price

### Summary

The `AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol::convertToShares` does not account for the unprocessed rewards. Given that the `AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol::_cbr` is likely to go up as rewards are added, The convertToShares overestimates than the real value.

If this should be used to calculate the collateral for liquidator in the Fraxlend pair, it might overestimate the amount of collateral for liquidator.


### Root Cause

The `AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol::convertToShares` is based on assets divided by `_cbr`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L100-L107

`_cbr` is proportional to the totalAsset:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L206

And when rewards are added and processed the totalAsset will increase:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L229

But the rewards could be added but not yet processed. Also the rewards are still in the TokenRewards and not yet distributed. In these cases the `_cbr` will still have stale value.

If the lower than real `_cbr` is used, the `convertToShares` will be overestimated than it really is. Therefore, the aspTKN per base will as well overestimated:

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Fraxlend pair uses aspTKNMinimalOracle.sol to calculate solvency and collateral amounts for liquidator


### External Pre-conditions

- Rewards are added to AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol


### Attack Path

liquidator liquidates after rewards are added to the aspTKN


### Impact

The overestimation aspTKN per base price may be used to calculate the collateral amounts for liquidator:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1135-L1136

Since the collateral's value does not count the rewards added, the liquidator will get more collateral amounts than what the real value is. As the result, the depositors of the fraxlend pair will get unfair socialization of debt.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding the rewards upon estimating the value of the aspTKN.
