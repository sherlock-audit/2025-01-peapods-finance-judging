# Deploying an `aspTKN` contract mints dead shares to a wrong address allowing a DoS

### Summary

Deploying an `aspTKN` contract mints dead shares to a wrong address allowing a DoS

### Root Cause

To deploy `AutoCompoundingPodLp`, `AutoCompoundingPodLpFactory::create()` must be called where we have this piece of code:
```solidity
_aspAddy = _deploy(getBytecode(_name, _symbol, _isSelfLendingPod, _pod, _dexAdapter, _indexUtils), _getFullSalt(_salt));
        if (address(_pod) != address(0) && minimumDepositAtCreation > 0) {
            _depositMin(_aspAddy, _pod);
        }
```
Due to the way the function works, frontrunning the deployment will result in the same address regardless of the caller. Then, `_depositMin()` is called to battle common issues like inflation attacks:
```solidity
    function _depositMin(address _aspAddy, IDecentralizedIndex _pod) internal {
        address _lpToken = _pod.lpStakingPool();
        IERC20(_lpToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), minimumDepositAtCreation);
        IERC20(_lpToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(_aspAddy, minimumDepositAtCreation);
        AutoCompoundingPodLp(_aspAddy).deposit(minimumDepositAtCreation, _msgSender());
    }
```
The issue is that the shares are incorrectly minted to the `msg.sender` which is the deployer. This means that these are not actually __dead__ shares as they can be withdrawn at any time, allowing a user to frontrun the deployment and manipulate the share value to cause a DoS.

### Attack Path

1. `AutoCompoundingPodLp` will be deployed but is frontran by a malicious actor, Alice
2. Alice does the following sequence in a batch:
- Alice provides the minimum deposit assets (1e3) and gets minted 1e3 shares in return
- Alice directly sends `X` amount of one of the reward tokens processed during most calls using the `_processRewardsToPodLp()` function, the goal here is to slightly increase the share value, ideally Alice will increase the total assets by 1, to a total of `1e3 + 1`
- Alice withdraws all but 1 of her assets which are `1e3`, the rewards in the above bullet point are processed and now the withdrawal formula will be `1e3 * 1e18 / (1e18 * (1e3 + 1) / 1e3) = 1000` due to the round up, now the state is 1 share but no assets
3. Now, upon someone depositing, depositing any amount of assets will lead to 0 shares which will revert due to this code:
```solidity
    function _deposit(uint256 _assets, uint256 _shares, address _receiver) internal {
        require(_assets != 0, "MA");
        require(_shares != 0, "MS");

        ...
    }
```

### Impact

DoS of the `AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function _depositMin(address _aspAddy, IDecentralizedIndex _pod) internal {
        address _lpToken = _pod.lpStakingPool();
        IERC20(_lpToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), minimumDepositAtCreation);
        IERC20(_lpToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(_aspAddy, minimumDepositAtCreation);
-       AutoCompoundingPodLp(_aspAddy).deposit(minimumDepositAtCreation, _msgSender());
+       AutoCompoundingPodLp(_aspAddy).deposit(minimumDepositAtCreation, address(0xdead));
    }
```
