# Leverage position can be impossible to close due to a non-initialized struct field

### Summary

Leverage position can be impossible to close due to a non-initialized struct field

### Root Cause

Upon removing leverage, we have the following piece of code:
```solidity
        LeverageFlashProps memory _props;
        _props.method = FlashCallbackMethod.REMOVE;
        _props.positionId = _positionId;
        _props.owner = _owner;
        bytes memory _additionalInfo = abi.encode(...);
        IFlashLoanSource(_getFlashSource(_positionId)).flash(_borrowTkn, _borrowAssetAmt, address(this), abi.encode(_props, _additionalInfo));
```
The `_props` struct gets his `method`, `positionId`, `owner` initialized with values. Then, it is encoded and provided to the `flash()` function of the flashloan source where that data is put in another struct, encoded and passed to the `flash()` function of a pod/index:
```solidity
        FlashData memory _fData = FlashData(_recipient, _token, _amount, _data, 0);
        IDecentralizedIndex(source).flash(address(this), _token, _amount, abi.encode(_fData));
```
After that, the data goes back to the `callback()` function in our flashloan source and is passed to the `callback()` function of the leverage manager where upon calling `_removeLeverageCallback()`, we decode it:
```solidity
(LeverageFlashProps memory _props, bytes memory _additionalInfo) = abi.decode(_d.data, (LeverageFlashProps, bytes));
```
If the amount paired amount received from the liquidity removal is insufficient to repay the flashloan, we call `_acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment()` where if the user has provided amount to send, we go in this block:
```solidity
if (_userProvidedDebtAmtMax > 0) {
            ...
            IERC20(_borrowToken).safeTransferFrom(_props.sender, address(this), _borrowAmtFromUser);
        }
```
As seen, the `_props.sender` has to provide the amount. The issue is that we didn't initialize it in the beginning and it was not set at any point during the flow, thus this is `address(0)` and would always lead to a revert.

### Attack Path

No attack path necessary, `Root Cause` explains it in great detail

### Impact

The basic DoS/broken functionality impact is clear, the functionality of users providing borrow tokens to cover the repayment is completely impossible.

The bigger issue is that the leverage can be impossible to remove if the pod tokens can not cover the necessary borrow tokens during the swap. In that case, there is no way to close the position as the user can not provide any extra debt tokens to do so.

### Mitigation

Initialize the sender as well
