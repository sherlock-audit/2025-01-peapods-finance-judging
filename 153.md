# FraxLendPair will bankruptcy or dos

### Summary

Overpayment during liquidation repays other borrowers' debts, reducing the value of borrow shares. This leads to two issues: 1. disruption of the borrowAsset function, and 2. interest accumulation on uncollateralized borrowers, making liquidation impossible and resulting in bad debt, impacting protocol stability.

### Root Cause

In [FraxLendPairCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1160-L1195) during liquidation, `_sharesToLiquidate` can exceed the user's share, potentially resulting in `totalBorrow.amount = 0` while `totalBorrow.shares != 0`, leading to the possibility of unlimited share inflation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

In the FraxLendPair contract, only the attacker performs deposit and borrow, while other users interact with the contract for deposits or loans.

### External Pre-conditions

The impact differs between executing the attack across multiple blocks and within a single block.

### Attack Path

- The `liquidate()` function allows repaid shares to exceed the borrower's share.

- When the repaid shares exceed the target borrower's shares, only the target borrower's shares are burned, while other borrowers' shares remain unchanged. This results in `totalBorrow.amount` reaching zero while `totalBorrow.shares` remains nonzero.

- The `removeCollateral()` function only verifies whether the user remains in a healthy state after collateral removal. However, liquidation status depends on `totalBorrow.amount`.

- The borrower's `borrowShare` is calculated as `totalBorrow * amount / totalAssets` when borrowing,when `borrowAmount` is 0, the obtained borrow share is equal to `borrowAmount`, maintaining a 1:1 ratio.

### Impact

1. disruption of the borrowAsset function, and 
2. 2. interest accumulation on uncollateralized borrowers, making liquidation impossible and resulting in bad debt, impacting protocol stability.

### PoC

FraxLendPair is created with DAI as the asset, and the attacker controls two accounts, A and B. 

*First Method*:
1. The attacker simultaneously calls `addCollateral()` with both accounts, adding collateral worth 1e18 DAI and 1,500e18 DAI.  
2. The attacker calls `borrowAsset()` using accounts A and B, borrowing 0.75e18 DAI (equivalent to 1e18 shares) and 1000e18 DAI (equivalent to 1000e18 shares), respectively. At this point, account A is on the verge of liquidation, and any slight price fluctuation will make it eligible for liquidation.  
3. As the collateral price drops, account A becomes eligible for liquidation. The attacker calls `liquidate()` on account A, setting `_sharesToLiquidate` to 1000.999999e18. This repays the borrowed assets for both A and B, but only A’s `borrowShare` is burned. As a result, `_totalBorrow.amount` becomes 1, while `_totalBorrow.shares` remains 1000e18.  
4. This manipulation inflates `totalShare` by 1000e18 times. The attacker then calls `addCollateral()` again using account A and borrows 0.75e6 DAI. Due to the inflated `totalShare`, the calculated share value is `(1000e18 * 0.75e18 / 1 = 0.75 * 1e39)`.  
5. Repeating steps 1–3 multiple times causes an overflow issue, making any subsequent borrowing attempts (even for 0.75e18 DAI) fail.  
6. The attacker withdraws B account's collateral, leaving some dust collateral in the protocol.
7. As a result, the borrow-related functions in FraxLendPair become unusable due to a DoS attack.

*Second Method*:
1. The attacker simultaneously uses accounts A and B to call `addCollateral()`, adding collateral worth 1e18 DAI and 1500e18 DAI.  
2. The attacker calls `borrowAsset()` with accounts A and B, borrowing 0.75e18 DAI and 1000e18 DAI, equivalent to 1e18 share and 1000e18 share. Account A is now on the verge of liquidation, and a slight price fluctuation can trigger liquidation.  
3. The collateral price drops, and account A is liquidated. The attacker calls `liquidate()`, setting `_sharesToLiquidate` to 1000.999999e18. This repays all borrow assets for both A and B, but only burns A’s borrow share. As a result, `_totalBorrow.amount` becomes 1, while `_totalBorrow.shares` remains 1000e18.  
4. The attacker deposits 1e18 DAI into account A and borrows 0.75e18 DAI, resulting in a share calculation of `(1000e18 * 0.75e18 / 1 = 0.75 * 1e36)`. Before this, the attacker creates a new account C, deposits 1500e18 DAI as collateral, and borrows 1000e18 DAI, receiving `1e42` shares.  
5. The attacker deposits 1e18 DAI into account A and borrows 0.75e18 DAI. Account A is again on the verge of liquidation, obtaining a share value of `(1e42 + 1e18) * 0.75e18 / (10e18 + 1)`.  
6. A further price fluctuation triggers another liquidation of account A. The attacker repays all liquidation funds, setting `totalBorrow.amount = 0` while `totalBorrow.shares = 1000e18 + 1e42 share`.  
7. Borrow share holders now include B and C. Since `totalBorrow.amount` is 0, the attacker uses account B or C to call `borrowAsset()`. Borrowing 10,000,000e18 DAI results in `10,000,000e18` shares, which are negligible compared to `totalBorrow.shares = 1000e18 + 1e42 share`, thus passing the `isSolvent` check.  
8. The protocol ultimately collapses.
### Mitigation

Add _shares ToLiquidate check in function `liquidate()`
