# `AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract is incompatible with EIP-4626

### Summary

The `AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract violates EIP-4626 specifications by introducing inconsistencies between `previewMint` and `mint`, as well as other `preview` functions (`previewDeposit`, `maxWithdraw`, `previewWithdraw`, and `previewRedeem`).
This discrepancy arises because `mint` calls `_processRewardsToPodLp()` before minting shares, whereas the corresponding `previewMint` function does not.

### Root Cause

- The `mint()` function first calls `_processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp)`, which modifies `_totalAssets` before computing assets. The `previewMint` function directly calls `_convertToAssets(_shares, Math.Rounding.Ceil)` without updating `_totalAssets`. As a result, the amount of assets returned by the `previewMint` function is actually fewer than the amount of assets required by the `mint` function.

- EIP-4626 specifies that `previewMint` function MUST return as close to and no fewer than the exact amount of assets that would be deposited in a mint call in the same transaction. I.e. mint should return the same or fewer assets as previewMint if called in the same transaction.

- The same issue applies to `previewDeposit()`, `maxWithdraw()`, `previewWithdraw()`, and `previewRedeem()`, as `_processRewardsToPodLp()` is called before actual share calculations in `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `redeem()`.
