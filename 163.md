# L0ckin7 - Lack of Access Control on `unstake` Function

L0ckin7
High


### Summary

The function does not check whether the user has sufficient staked tokens before allowing them to burn tokens and withdraw staking tokens.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/StakingPoolToken.sol#L77

```solidity
function unstake(uint256 _amount) external override {
    _burn(_msgSender(), _amount); // Burns the user's tokens
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _amount); // Transfers staking tokens to the user
    emit Unstake(_msgSender(), _amount);
}
```

### Impact

Direct loss of funds.
If an attacker can manipulate their balance or bypass checks, they could drain the contract of staking tokens.

### Attack Path

The attacker stakes a small amount of tokens to become a valid staker in the contract.
The attacker calls the `unstake` function with a large amount that exceeds their staked balance.
Since there is no check to ensure the user has sufficient staked tokens, the contract burns the attacker's tokens and transfers the staking tokens to the attacker.
The attacker repeats the `unstake` operation multiple times, until eventually the contract's staking token balance is drained.

 ### Recommendations

Add a check to ensure the user has sufficient staked tokens before allowing the `unstake` operation. This can be done by verifying the user's balance before burning tokens.

```solidity
function unstake(uint256 _amount) external override {
    require(balanceOf(_msgSender()) >= _amount, "Insufficient staked tokens"); // Check user's balance
    _burn(_msgSender(), _amount); // Burns the user's tokens
    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(_msgSender(), _amount); // Transfers staking tokens to the user
    emit Unstake(_msgSender(), _amount);
}
```

This ensures the user has enough staked tokens to unstake the requested amount.
If the user does not have sufficient tokens, the transaction will revert with the error message "Insufficient staked tokens."
