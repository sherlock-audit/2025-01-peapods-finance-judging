# A lock modifier will cause a revert when the flashloan source is the same as the pod token provided

### Summary

A lock modifier will cause a revert when the flashloan source is the same as the pod token provided

### Root Cause

Users can add leverage using the `LeverageManager`. There, this is a very generalized and simplified flow that occurs, only mentioning things important for the issue:
1. Provide an amount of pod tokens
2. Take a flashloan from a flashloan source, usually this would be the `DecentralizedIndex` contract which is the pod token contract
3. Provide liquidity using the borrowed token (not always that exact token but this is a simplified flow) and the pod token using `DecentralizedIndex.addLiquidityV2()` where `DecentralizedIndex` is the provided pod token

The issue is that taking a flashloan from `DecentralizedIndex` has a lock (reentrancy) modifier. Then, adding liquidity using `DecentralizedIndex.addLiquidityV2()` also has a lock modifier. Thus, if the flashloan source is the same pod as the pod tokens the user is providing, then a revert will occur.

__NOTE__: This is a completely expected scenario, users can provide any pod tokens they choose and each asset has its own flashloan source, thus it is completely normal and expected for a user to provide pod tokens which is the flashloan source of a specific asset. Causing a revert in that case effectively disallows users from using specific pod tokens, it is essentially equivalent to going to a bank and providing `USD` and then they say `USD` isn't accepted (when it should).

### Attack Path

No attack path necessary, `Root Cause` explains how the issue occurs

### Impact

Incorrect reverts disallowing users from using specific pod tokens

### PoC

### Mitigation

Consider implementing special cases in the `lock` modifier to handle such scenarios
