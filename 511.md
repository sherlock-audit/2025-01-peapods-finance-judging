# `LendingAssetVault.whitelistDeposit` will be DOSed when the asset amount is higher that `vaultUtilization`

### Summary

`LendingAssetVault.whitelistDeposit` is used by vaults to deposit an asset. This deposited amount is subtracted from `vaultUtilization` which can be a lower value leading to a denial of service.

This is similar to a previously fixed issue in `LendingAssetVault.redeemFromVault` 

### Root Cause

`LendingAssetVault.whitelistDeposit` subtracts `_assetAmt` from vaultUtilization[_vault] 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L246-L254


```solidity
    function whitelistDeposit(uint256 _assetAmt) external override onlyWhitelist {
        address _vault = _msgSender();
        _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
        vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _assetAmt > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultDeposits[_vault] : _assetAmt;
        vaultUtilization[_vault] -= _assetAmt;
        _totalAssetsUtilized -= _assetAmt;
        IERC20(_asset).safeTransferFrom(_vault, address(this), _assetAmt);
        emit WhitelistDeposit(_vault, _assetAmt);
    }
```

The issue is that `vaultUtilization` is regularly modified by `_updateAssetMetadataFromVault` using the change in `cbr` which can cause it to be a lower value than the assets.

```solidity
        uint256 _currentAssetsUtilized = vaultUtilization[_vault];
        uint256 _changeUtilizedState = (_currentAssetsUtilized * _vaultAssetRatioChange) / PRECISION;
        vaultUtilization[_vault] = _prevVaultCbr > _vaultWhitelistCbr[_vault]
            ? _currentAssetsUtilized < _changeUtilizedState ? 0 : _currentAssetsUtilized - _changeUtilizedState
            : _currentAssetsUtilized + _changeUtilizedState;
```

The subtraction `vaultUtilization[_vault] -= _assetAmt;` can therefore cause an underflow leading to a denial of service.
A similar logic applied to `vaultDeposits[_vault]` should also be applied to `vaultUtilization[_vault]`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

`vaultUtilization[_vault]` is less than `_assetAmt`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A vault attempts to repay an asset where `FraxlendPairCore.repayAsset` is called.
2. This leads to `LendingAssetVault.whitelistDeposit` being called.
3. The subtraction `vaultUtilization[_vault] -= _assetAmt` fails due to an underflow.

### Impact

Denial of service of a vault trying to repay an asset. This could be to avoid a liquidation making it time sensitive.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Subtract the lower of the values between `vaultUtilization[_vault]` and `_assetAmt` similar to the logic applied to `vaultDeposits[_vault] `.
