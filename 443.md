# AutoCompoundingPodLp `_getSwapAmt()` does not return correct value for pairedLpTKN -> pTKN swaps.


### Summary

AutoCompoundingPodLp `_getSwapAmt()` does not return correct value for pairedLpTKN -> pTKN swaps.

### Root Cause

First, let's see how the autocompounding process works: 1) swap rewardTKN -> pairedLpTKN, 2) swap a portion (roughly half) of pairedLpTKN -> pTKN, 3) add pairedLpTKN, pTKN to UniV2 LP, 4) stake LP token to spTKN.

In step 2, it uses a complicated formula to calculate how much pairedLpTKN should be swapped to pTKN. This formula is supposed be more accurate considering reserve change after swap and swap fees. However, a critical bug here is it does not use the correct reserve amount.

Since `_t0` is always pairedLpTKN, and `_t1` is always pTKN, inside `_getSwapAmt()` we would always assume token0 is pairedLpTKN and use reserve0. This is obviously incorrect for the case if pairedLpTKN is token1, where we should use reserve1.

Now let's assess the impact. Since pTKN is always 18 decimals and pairedLpTKN can be 6 decimals (e.g. USDC), let's assume the pool contains 1000e6 USDC and 1000e18 pTKN, and we want to swap 200e6 USDC.

Using the correct formula `(math.sqrt(r * (amt * 3988000 + r * 3988009)) - (r * 1997)) / 1994 / 1e6`, plugging in `r = 1000e6, amt = 200e6` we have `95.59e6`. However, if we plug in `r = 1000e18`, we have `100.16e6`.

This means we swap a excessive non-trivial amount of pairedLpTKN to pTKN. This will cause pTKN to be stuck in the contract, and it will accumulate within time.

```solidity
    function _pairedLpTokenToPodLp(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _deadline) internal returns (uint256 _amountOut) {
        address _pairedLpToken = pod.PAIRED_LP_TOKEN();
@>      uint256 _pairedSwapAmt = _getSwapAmt(_pairedLpToken, address(pod), _pairedLpToken, _amountIn);
        uint256 _pairedRemaining = _amountIn - _pairedSwapAmt;
        uint256 _minPtknOut;
        ...
    }

    // optimal one-sided supply LP: https://blog.alphaventuredao.io/onesideduniswap/
    function _getSwapAmt(address _t0, address _t1, address _swapT, uint256 _fullAmt) internal view returns (uint256) {
        // @audit-bug: This always return r0, which may be the wrong reserve.
        (uint112 _r0, uint112 _r1) = DEX_ADAPTER.getReserves(DEX_ADAPTER.getV2Pool(_t0, _t1));
        uint112 _r = _swapT == _t0 ? _r0 : _r1;
        return (_sqrt(_r * (_fullAmt * 3988000 + _r * 3988009)) - (_r * 1997)) / 1994;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- For the UniV2 pool, pairedLpTKN is token1.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

No attack path required. Explained above.

### Impact

Non-trivial amount of pTKN is stuck in the contract.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Use the correct reserve in `_getSwapAmt`.
