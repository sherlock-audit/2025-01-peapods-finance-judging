# Permanent Fee Processing Freeze via Unhandled `_shortCircuitRewards` in `flashMint()`

The function [flashMint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L424-L436) sets `_shortCircuitRewards = 1` to temporarily disable reward processing during a flash mint operation. However, if the function fails before resetting `_shortCircuitRewards = 0`, this flag remains permanently set, causing `_processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()` to always return early without processing accumulated fees. This is because `_processPreSwapFeesAndSwap()` contains [an early exit condition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L186-L188):  
```solidity
if (_shortCircuitRewards == 1) {
    return;
}
```  
Since `_shortCircuitRewards` is never reset upon failure, all future fee swaps are blocked indefinitely, preventing rewards distribution and liquidity fee conversion. Any user can trigger this issue by calling `flashMint()`, ensuring a failure occurs (e.g. using a contract that reverts in `callback(_data)`), thereby freezing the protocolâ€™s fee processing permanently.  

## Impact
The primary impact is that the protocol stops processing accumulated fees, leading to zero revenue distribution, no staking rewards, and loss of liquidity incentives, effectively crippling the ecosystem.  

## Mitigation
Implement a `try...catch` block in `flashMint()` to always reset `_shortCircuitRewards = 0`, ensuring that a failure does not permanently disable fee processing.
