# Partial Liquidators can Cause the Last Liquidator to Suffer a Loss

### Summary

When a position is liquidated, the liquidators are paid a certain percent of fees. In some positions, partial liquidators will get an unfair shares of the fees when they liquidate first and the final liquidators will be left with small crumbs of fees or even full losses which will cause a lot of insolvent loan positions to never be liquidated. 

### Root Cause

The [`liquidate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1100) function allows a third party to repay a borrower's debt if they have become insolvent. The liquidators get paid a percentage of collateral as fees when they liquidate the position as a bonus: 
```solidity 
function liquidate(uint128 _sharesToLiquidate, uint256 _deadline, address _borrower)
       ...

  uint256 _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator =
@>    (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + cleanLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;
  
  _leftoverCollateral = (_userCollateralBalance.toInt256() - _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator.toInt256());
  
  _collateralForLiquidator = _leftoverCollateral <= 0
    ? _userCollateralBalance
@>    : (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + dirtyLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;
  
  if (protocolLiquidationFee > 0) {
    _feesAmount = (protocolLiquidationFee * _collateralForLiquidator) / LIQ_PRECISION;
    _collateralForLiquidator = _collateralForLiquidator - _feesAmount;
```

This bonus is calculated as either the `cleanLiquidationFee` or the `dirtyLiquidationFee` (as shown above) depending on whether the liquidator liquidates the entire position or only a partial position. 

The problem is that in certain situations, liquidators who liquidate the position last will not get their fair share of the collateral tokens. This happens because the final liquidator gets the entirety of the collateral the position holds. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The maxLTV of a Pair is set to `100 - maxLTV â‰² liquidationFees`.
2. Borrower takes out a loan.
3. Borrower's loan becomes insolvent.
4. A series of liquidators partially liquidate the function. 
5. The final liquidator does not get their fair share. 

### External Pre-conditions

1. The borrower's loan becomes insolvent due to various external factors.

### Attack Path

Take the following situation as an example: 
* A loan's `maxLTV` is `95%`, and the `cleanLiquidationFee` is `6%`. 
* The loan while being liquidated has `100` assets, and `105.26` collateral. For simplicity, let's say that the exchange rate is `1:1`. 
* This gives `LTV = 95%`. This will trigger liquidation. 

Now, lets say that `Liquidator_1` comes to partially liquidate half of the position. 

While the position is being liquidated, the following code will trigger: 
```solidity 
_leftoverCollateral = (_userCollateralBalance.toInt256() - _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator.toInt256());

_collateralForLiquidator = _leftoverCollateral <= 0 ? _userCollateralBalance : (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + dirtyLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;
```

The `_collateralForLiquidator` will be set to $50 \times 1.054 = 52.7$. 

So, the liquidator gets transferred the `_userCollateralBalance` of `52.7`. 

Which means the position has the following balances, $Asset = 100 - 50 = 50$, and $Collateral = 105.26 - 52.7 = 52.56$. 

So, the person who liquidates the remaining position will see the following: 
* They transfer in `50` assets, and get `52.56` collateral back. 
* They were promised a `6%` bonus when they agreed to liquidate, which should come out to `53` collateral. 
* **Hence, they suffered a $6 - 5.12 = 0.88$% loss. (Note: $(52.56 - 50)/50 = 5.12$%)**

Let's consider a similar situation with an even larger partial liquidation, 

If the first person liquidated `90%` of the position: 

`Liquidator_1`: Asset: `90`; Collateral: `94.86`

What remains in the position is: 
Asset: `10`; Collateral: `5.14`

This means either the final liquidator needs to suffer an incredible amount of loss or that the protocol will have to deal with the inevitable increase in insolvent loans that will never be liquidated because their collaterals are not enough. 

### Impact

The final liquidators of a position will have to suffer losses if they want to liquidate the position. Their loss will be higher than 0.1%, and may even reach `50%` in certain situations.
