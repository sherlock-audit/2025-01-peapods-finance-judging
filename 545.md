# Vulnerability Due to Use of `block.timestamp` as a Deadline in Uniswap V2 Swaps Functions

## **Summary**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/dex/UniswapDexAdapter.sol#L79

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/dex/UniswapDexAdapter.sol#L102

The use of `block.timestamp` directly as a deadline in Uniswap V2 functions will cause transactions to fail unexpectedly for users as miners or front-running bots can delay execution, causing the transaction to expire before being included in a block.

## **Root Cause**


```solidity 
function swapV2Single(address _tokenIn,address _tokenOut,uint256 _amountIn,uint256 _amountOutMin,address _recipient) external virtual override returns (uint256 _amountOut) {

uint256 _outBefore = IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient);

if (_amountIn == 0) {

_amountIn = IERC20(_tokenIn).balanceOf(address(this));

} else {

IERC20(_tokenIn).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amountIn);

}

address[] memory _path = new address[](2);

_path[0] = _tokenIn;

_path[1] = _tokenOut;

IERC20(_tokenIn).safeIncreaseAllowance(V2_ROUTER, _amountIn);

IUniswapV2Router02(V2_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(

_amountIn, _amountOutMin, _path, _recipient, block.timestamp  <=== HERE

);

return IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient) - _outBefore;

}
```


In [`swapV2Single`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/dex/UniswapDexAdapter.sol#L79), `swapV2SingleExactOut`, `addLiquidity`, and `removeLiquidity`, the function calls Uniswap V2’s `swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens` and other similar functions using `block.timestamp` as the deadline, making transactions vulnerable to front-running and unexpected failures.

## **Internal Pre-conditions**

1. The contract calls Uniswap V2’s `swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens` with `block.timestamp` as the deadline.
2. A user submits a transaction with a tight gas limit, causing it to remain pending in the mempool.

## **External Pre-conditions**

1. Gas fees fluctuate, causing the transaction to remain in the mempool longer than expected.
2. A front-running bot sees the transaction and delays execution, causing it to fail due to an expired deadline.

## **Attack Path**

1. **User submits a transaction** calling `swapV2Single` or similar functions.
2. **Transaction remains in the mempool** due to fluctuating gas fees.
3. **A bot or miner delays execution** until the deadline expires.
4. **The transaction fails** and reverts, resulting in frustration for users.
## **Attack Path ( Explanation)**

1. **User Initiates a Swap:**
    
    - A user calls the `swapV2Single` function to swap tokens using Uniswap V2.
    - The function internally calls `swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens`, setting `block.timestamp` as the deadline.
2. **Transaction Remains Pending:**
    
    - Due to network congestion or a low gas fee, the transaction does not get included in the next block and stays in the mempool.
3. **Miner or Bot Delays Execution:**
    
    - A miner or a front-running bot detects the transaction and chooses to delay its inclusion in a block.
    - If the transaction remains in the mempool for even a few seconds beyond the block's confirmation time, `block.timestamp` will have increased beyond the deadline.
4. **Transaction Fails and Reverts:**
    
    - When the transaction finally gets included in a block, the deadline check in Uniswap V2 fails, causing the transaction to revert.
    - The user loses the gas fees spent on the failed transaction.
5. **User Faces a Poor Experience:**
    
    - The user is forced to resubmit the transaction with a higher gas fee or adjust parameters, causing frustration and inefficiency.

## **Impact**

The users suffer transaction failures due to expired deadlines, causing inconvenience, potential lost gas fees, and degraded user experience.


## **Mitigation**

1. **Allow user-defined deadlines**: Add a `_deadline` parameter in the function, which the user can specify based on their risk tolerance.
2. **Add a grace period**: Instead of `block.timestamp`, use `block.timestamp + X seconds` where `X` is a buffer (e.g., `300` for 5 minutes).
3. **Implement transaction monitoring**: Notify users when their transactions are at risk of expiration.
