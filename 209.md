# Users can recoup their flash minting fees, resulting loss for others

### Summary

Users can recoup their flash minting fees, resulting loss for others

NOTE: The issue assumes 0 bond/debond fees. According to the README, this is a valid case:
>Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?

>For all access-controlled functions we have validations on restricting values at the beginning of the setters, so refer to those.

As seen, any expected value restrictions are in the setters. As seen in the code, these are the validations:
```solidity
        require(__fees.buy <= (uint256(DEN) * 20) / 100);
        require(__fees.sell <= (uint256(DEN) * 20) / 100);
        require(__fees.burn <= (uint256(DEN) * 70) / 100);
        require(__fees.bond <= (uint256(DEN) * 99) / 100);
        require(__fees.debond <= (uint256(DEN) * 99) / 100);
        require(__fees.partner <= (uint256(DEN) * 5) / 100);
```
Thus, we can see that 0 bond and debond fees are allowed, so according to the README, they are valid values in the scope of the audit.

### Root Cause

Users can flashmint using the below function:
```solidity
function flashMint(address _recipient, uint256 _amount, bytes calldata _data) external override lock {
        _shortCircuitRewards = 1;
        uint256 _fee = _amount / 1000;
        _mint(_recipient, _amount);
        IFlashLoanRecipient(_recipient).callback(_data);
        _burn(_recipient, _amount);
        _totalSupply -= _fee == 0 ? 1 : _fee;
        _burn(_msgSender(), _fee == 0 ? 1 : _fee);
        _shortCircuitRewards = 0;
}
```
Then, they have to pay 0.1% of the amount minted as fees. The issue is that they can simply sandwich the mint by flashloaning the underlying pod asset, bonding it and then after the flashmint, debonding. This will allow them to recoup a huge portion of their fees as they will own a huge amount of the total supply.

### Attack Path

1. There are 10,000\$ of USDC deposited in a pod, the pod is made up of only that token, the total supply is 1:1, so 10_000e6
2. User wants to flash mint himself 10000e6 pod tokens, he has to burn 10e6 pod tokens as fee
3. User flashloans 1,000,000\$ USDC from Morpho (free flashloans, there are currently a lot more than that as available USDC to flashloan) and bonds them, now the total supply is `1_000_000e6 + 10_000e6`, same goes for the total assets
4. The total supply decreases by 1e6 due to the fees, now it is `1_000_000e6 + 10_000e6 - 10e6`, total assets are still `1_000_000e6 + 10_000e6`
5. The user redeems his 1_000_000e6 shares and receives `1000000e6 * (1000000e6 + 10000e6) / (1000000e6 + 10000e6 - 10e6) = 1000009901088` assets (actual formulas used in the code are different but capture the same goal and idea, they would yield pretty much the same results)
6. The user repays his flashloan and has 9901088 tokens leftover which is ~9.9\$, he only paid ~0.1\$ as fees instead of the 10\$ he actually had to

### Impact

Users can essentially avoid paying the flashmint fees. Users can also simply frontrun and backrun anyone who flashmints to steal out of the suppliers in the same way (except the flashloan as it wouldn't be in the same transaction).

In the example given, if we imagine 1 depositor before the flashint, this results in a loss of ~99% (only getting ~0.1\$ instead of 10\$) and a loss of ~10\$, sufficient of High severity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a delay between being able to bond and debond. Another option which would be harder to implement is a time-based vesting mechanism similar to how a staking contract like Synthetix would work.
