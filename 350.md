# Unbounded reward tokens array length may lead to out of gas

### Summary

The `TokenRewards` contract's `_allRewardsTokens` array can grow indefinitely as there is no limit on the total number of tokens that can be added over time. While `RewardsWhitelist` limits active tokens to 12, tokens can be repeatedly added and removed, causing the array to grow without bounds, potentially leading to out-of-gas scenarios in reward distribution.


### Root Cause

The `TokenRewards` contract [adds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L212) tokens to `_allRewardsTokens` array when they are first deposited:
```solidity
if (!_depositedRewardsToken[_token]) {
    _depositedRewardsToken[_token] = true;
    _allRewardsTokens.push(_token);
}
```
However:
- Tokens are never removed from this array.
- `RewardsWhitelist`'s [MAX](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/RewardsWhitelist.sol#L8) = 12 only limits simultaneously active tokens.
- [`toggleRewardsToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/RewardsWhitelist.sol#L35) allows removing and adding different tokens repeatedly.
- `_allRewardsTokens` keeps permanent record of all historically added tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Frequent changes in reward token configuration through `toggleRewardsToken` calls.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Over time, protocol adds and removes different reward tokens.
2. Each new token gets permanently recorded in `_allRewardsTokens`.
3. `_distributeReward` becomes increasingly expensive.
4. Eventually, reward distribution becomes impossible due to gas limits.

### Impact

The ever-growing `_allRewardsTokens` array impacts gas costs as it is iterated over 4 times during each share change process:
1. From address: claim rewards
2. From address: reset existing rewards
3. To address: claim rewards
4. To address: reset existing rewards

Since `_distributeReward` and `_resetExcluded` iterate through the entire array in each case:
```solidity
for (uint256 _i; _i < _allRewardsTokens.length; _i++) {
```

This means that every share transfer operation's gas cost grows with the historical number of reward tokens. As the array grows with each new token ever added (even if later removed), share transfers will eventually become too expensive to execute.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Iterate only over active tokens or implement a max limit for the total number of reward tokens that can be added to the system over its lifetime.
