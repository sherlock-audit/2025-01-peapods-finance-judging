# Share Dilution Due to Reward Processing Order

### Summary

Processing rewards before share calculation causes share dilution as users receive fewer shares when withdrawing or depositing assets after rewards are processed.

[deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L124)

[withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L162)

### Root Cause

In `AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol`, reward processing occurs before share calculation in both `deposit` and `withdraw` functions:

```solidity
 function withdraw(uint256 _assets, address _receiver, address _owner) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);        <@
        _shares = _convertToShares(_assets, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
        _withdraw(_assets, _shares, _msgSender(), _owner, _receiver);
    }
```

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);                <@
        _shares = _convertToShares(_assets, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
    }
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users suffer share dilution during `withdrawal` and `deposit`, receiving fewer shares for their assets due to reward processing occurring before share calculation.

### PoC

Add this test in `AutoCompoundingPodLpTest.t.sol`

```solidity
 function testWithdrawShareCalculationIssue() public {
        uint256 initialDeposit = 1000 * 1e18;
        deal(address(mockStakingPoolToken), address(this), initialDeposit);
        mockStakingPoolToken.approve(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), initialDeposit);
        autoCompoundingPodLp.deposit(initialDeposit, address(this));

        address[] memory rewardTokens = new address[](2);
        rewardTokens[0] = address(rewardToken1);
        rewardTokens[1] = address(rewardToken2);
        mockTokenRewards.setProcessedRewardTokens(rewardTokens);

        uint256 rewardAmount = 1000 * 1e18;
        uint256 lpAmountOut = 1000 * 1e18; // 1:1 conversion for clarity
        mockDexAdapter.setSwapV3SingleReturn(lpAmountOut);
        deal(autoCompoundingPodLp.pod().PAIRED_LP_TOKEN(), address(autoCompoundingPodLp), lpAmountOut * 3);
        mockIndexUtils.setAddLPAndStakeReturn(lpAmountOut);

        rewardToken1.mint(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), rewardAmount);

        emit log_named_uint("Initial total assets", autoCompoundingPodLp.totalAssets());
        emit log_named_uint("Initial total supply", autoCompoundingPodLp.totalSupply());

        uint256 withdrawAmount = 500 * 1e18;
        uint256 expectedShares = autoCompoundingPodLp.convertToShares(withdrawAmount);
        emit log_named_uint("Expected shares (pre-rewards)", expectedShares);

        uint256 actualShares = autoCompoundingPodLp.withdraw(withdrawAmount, address(this), address(this));

        emit log_named_uint("Final total assets", autoCompoundingPodLp.totalAssets());
        emit log_named_uint("Final total supply", autoCompoundingPodLp.totalSupply());
        emit log_named_uint("Actual shares burned", actualShares);

        assertLt(actualShares, expectedShares, "Share calculation should be affected by reward processing");
    }
```

```solidity
[PASS] testWithdrawShareCalculationIssue() (gas: 1574426)
Logs:
  Initial total assets: 1000000000000000000000
  Initial total supply: 1000000000000000000000
  Expected shares (pre-rewards): 500000000000000000000
  Final total assets: 1500000000000000000000
  Final total supply: 750000000000000000000
  Actual shares burned: 250000000000000000000
```

### Mitigation

The most straightforward solution would be to:

* Calculate shares before processing rewards.
