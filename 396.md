# No slippage as a design choice would certainly be prone to bot sandwich attacks

### Summary

In the app's design choice section, the reason that zero slippage was mentioned is due to the protocol's confidence that prices would not that much in order for a bot to snipe the transaction and sandwich attack it (front-run attack).

However, I think that is a very bold and unrealistic claim to say the least, the trades happening in Peapods are certainly bottable because they will be deployed on public chains and not a big price movement is needed for a tx to be profitable via a sandwich attack.

### Root Cause

Setting zero slippage in numerous places in which swaps occur is disastrous and is certainly prone to bot attacks.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Bot sniping the app

### External Pre-conditions

A medium sized traded occuring

### Attack Path

1. A swap is initiated via `TokenRewards::depositFromPairedLPToken()` and inside it `_swapForRewards()` is making a call to a uni v3 pool with zero slippage. Let's say that the trade is going to move the price with 5% due to its size
2. A bot sees that and sandwiches the trade and makes 3% profit (remember that POOL_FEE is 1% and in order to make sandwich attack, you need to make two trades), thus causing a loss of 3% that could be avoided

### Impact

Loss of funds and remember, there are several functions that have zero slippage, I've listed only one scenario in the attack path, but other functions prone to this are -> `_feeSwap()`, `_tokenToPairedLpToken()` and others.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make it so that there is some slippage, bots will use this opportunity and snipe the application if there's no limit.
