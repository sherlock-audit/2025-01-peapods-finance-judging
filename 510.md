# Users will experience unexpected lockup periods due to parameter update race conditions

### Summary

The lack of slippage protection for the lockup period in VotingPool.sol will cause unexpected lock durations for users as admin parameter updates can be processed in the same block as user stake transactions.

### Root Cause

In VotingPool.sol:39-40 the stake function does not validate the expected lockup period, allowing transactions to execute with different parameters than when they were initiated,if the admin changes the lock period at the same time 
```solidity 
function stake(address _asset, uint256 _amount) external override {
    require(_amount > 0, "A");
    IERC20(_asset).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
    stakes[_msgSender()][_asset].lastStaked = block.timestamp;
    stakes[_msgSender()][_asset].lockupPeriod = lockupPeriod; // @audit: Uses global lockupPeriod without validation
    _updateUserState(_msgSender(), _asset, _amount);
    emit AddStake(_msgSender(), _asset, _amount);
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to call setLockupPeriod() to change lockup period from 7 days to 40 days
User needs to have a pending stake transaction expecting 7 days lockup
Both transactions need to be in the same block

### External Pre-conditions

Network congestion needs to allow multiple transactions in the same block like etherium 

### Attack Path

User initiates stake transaction expecting 7-day lockup period
Admin submits lockup period update to 40 days for legitimate reasons
Both transactions end up in the same block
Admin's update processes first
User's stake processes with unexpected 40-day lockup

### Impact

The users suffer unexpected lockup extensions. While funds remain safe and the admin is trusted, users' funds get locked for longer than intended (e.g., 40 days instead of 7 days).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add slippage protection for lockup period:
```solidity
solidity
CopyInsert
function stake(
    address _asset, 
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 expectedLockupPeriod
) external {
    require(expectedLockupPeriod == lockupPeriod, "Lockup period changed");
    // rest of the function
}
```
This ensures users' transactions revert if the lockup period changes between transaction submission and execution, preventing unexpected lock durations.
