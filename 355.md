# Incorrect Protocol Fee Deduction in `_tokenToPodLp()` Can Cause Reward Conversion Failure

In the [_tokenToPodLp()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L233-L247) function, the contract attempts to convert rewards tokens into paired LP tokens and then intopod LP tokens [while deducting a protocol fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L242). However, the fee calculation is applied after the swap operation on `_pairedOut`, which is subject to swap slippage and market fluctuations. If `_pairedOut` is lower than expected due to these factors, the fee deduction can consume nearly all of the received tokens, potentially leaving an insufficient balance to proceed with `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()`, leading to a transaction failure. The issue lies in this block of code:  

```solidity
    function _tokenToPodLp(address _token, uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountLpOutMin, uint256 _deadline)
        internal
        returns (uint256 _lpAmtOut)
    {
        uint256 _pairedOut = _tokenToPairedLpToken(_token, _amountIn);
        if (_pairedOut > 0) {
            uint256 _pairedFee = (_pairedOut * protocolFee) / 1000;
            if (_pairedFee > 0) {
                _protocolFees += _pairedFee;
                _pairedOut -= _pairedFee;
            }
            _lpAmtOut = _pairedLpTokenToPodLp(_pairedOut, _deadline);
            require(_lpAmtOut >= _amountLpOutMin, "M");
        }
    }
```
By applying the fee after the swap, `_pairedOut` can become too small to stake, leading to a failed reward conversion that may prevent compounding from proceeding.  

## Impact
A failed `_processRewardsToPodLp()` function halts auto-compounding, leading to stuck rewards, inefficient LP staking, and potential loss of yield for depositors.  

## Mitigation
Deduct the protocol fee before the swap, ensuring a predictable fee calculation and preventing `_pairedOut` from being reduced to an unusable amount.
