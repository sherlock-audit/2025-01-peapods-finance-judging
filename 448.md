# Improperly implemented proxy pattern will cause storage layout inconsistency for all pods


### Summary

The lack of proper storage layout management in the beacon proxy pattern will cause storage corruption for all index contract users as future upgrades may shift storage slots, leading to unpredictable contract behavior or complete failure.


### Root Cause

The failure to properly manage storage layout in a beacon proxy setup is a critical design flaw, as adding new storage variables can inadvertently shift existing storage slots, leading to data corruption or undefined behavior. Both WeightedIndex and DecentralizedIndex define their own contract state variables, increasing the complexity of maintaining a consistent storage layout. Additionally, the project integrates multiple external dependencies within DecentralizedIndex, further heightening the risk of misalignment, as any modification to storage can disrupt these integrations or cause unintended side effects.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The project deploys new WeightedIndex instances using a BeaconProxy, inheriting from DecentralizedIndex.
2. DecentralizedIndex lacks a proper storage upgrade mechanism (e.g., storage gap or explicit storage slot assignments).
3. A new implementation of WeightedIndex is deployed without maintaining strict adherence to the previous storage layout.


### External Pre-conditions

1. The project upgrades the beacon with a new implementation of WeightedIndex.
2. The new implementation introduces additional storage variables, causing a misalignment in existing storage slots.


### Attack Path

1. A new implementation of WeightedIndex is deployed and set in the beacon.
2. Storage layout misalignment occurs due to additional or reordered storage variables.
3. Existing index contracts experience unpredictable behavior, potentially leading to contract failure, loss of funds, or broken integrations.


### Impact

The users of all WeightedIndex instances suffer from potential loss of funds or broken contract functionality due to storage corruption. If storage slots shift unexpectedly, critical data may become unreadable or overwritten, leading to complete contract failure.


### PoC

_No response_


### Mitigation

Implement OpenZeppelinâ€™s recommended storage gap pattern or structured storage slots to ensure safe storage upgrades.
