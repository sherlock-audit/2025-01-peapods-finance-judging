# MEV bots will extract unlimited value from users despite protocol's "small value" assumptions

### Summary

The combination of using `block.timestamp` as transaction deadlines and allowing unlimited slippage (0 minimum output) in DEX adapter contracts will cause significant value extraction for users as miners and MEV bots can manipulate transaction ordering and execute sandwich attacks without any economic protection mechanisms.

### Root Cause

The choice to implement unlimited slippage and use `block.timestamp` as deadline is a mistake as it removes two critical DeFi security protections: economic slippage guards and time-based execution boundaries. This is evidenced in multiple contracts:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/AerodromeDexAdapter.sol#L75-L76

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L49-L50

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/dex/UniswapDexAdapter.sol#L78-L79

1. In `AerodromeDexAdapter.sol`, `CamelotDexAdapter.sol`, and `UniswapDexAdapter.sol`, all swap functions use `block.timestamp` as deadline:
```solidity
IAerodromeRouter(V2_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
    _amountIn, _amountOutMin, _routes, _recipient, block.timestamp
);
```

2. Protocol explicitly allows 100% slippage in certain functions, setting `_amountOutMin` to 0.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A transaction must be submitted using one of the DEX adapter contracts' swap functions
2. The transaction must use the unlimited slippage option (where `_amountOutMin` = 0)
3. The value of the transaction must be large enough to offset gas costs for MEV extraction

### External Pre-conditions

1. There must be sufficient liquidity in the relevant pools to execute sandwich attacks
2. Gas prices must be low enough relative to potential MEV profit
3. Block space must be available for sandwich attack transactions

### Attack Path

1. User submits a swap transaction with unlimited slippage through a DEX adapter
2. MEV bot/miner detects the transaction in the mempool
3. Bot/miner constructs a sandwich attack:
   - Front-run: Buy the output token to increase price
   - Target transaction executes with no slippage protection
   - Back-run: Sell the output token for profit
4. Transaction is included in block with manipulated ordering
5. Due to `block.timestamp` deadline, the transaction must execute in the same block, giving user no chance to react


### Impact

Users are exposed to significant financial losses from MEV extraction due to the combination of unlimited slippage and `block.timestamp` deadlines, creating a optimal scenario for value extraction:

1. Direct Financial Impact:
- Users can experience losses up to 100% of their trade value due to no slippage protection
- MEV bots can maximize extraction by sandwiching transactions without economic limits
- The cumulative loss across all protocol users compounds over time
- Even "small value" transactions become profitable targets when:
  - Gas prices are low
  - Multiple transactions can be bundled
  - Complex MEV strategies are employed

2. Systemic Protocol Risk:
```solidity
// Current implementation effectively says:
if (block.timestamp <= block.timestamp) { // Always true
    executeSwap(unlimited_slippage);      // No protection
}
```
This creates:
- A systematic vulnerability affecting all users
- No protection even for high-value transactions
- Permanent MEV attack surface that scales with protocol usage

1. Design Flaws:
The development team's assumption that "transactions will be small enough to not be profitable for MEV" is fundamentally flawed because:
- MEV extraction profitability is not solely based on individual transaction size
- Bot operations are highly optimized for minimal profitable opportunities
- Protocol growth will naturally lead to larger transaction values
- The cost of implementing proper protections is negligible compared to risk

2. Protocol Disadvantage:
- Users may migrate to competing protocols with proper MEV protections
- Protocol reputation could suffer from documented MEV losses

3. Loss Scenarios:
Even with "small" transactions:
- 1,000 transactions Ã— 2% average MEV extraction = 20% aggregate value loss
- Flash loan leveraged attacks can amplify extraction
- Sandwich attacks can compound with other MEV strategies
- Market volatility increases potential extraction values

The development team should  reconsider this design choice because:
1. "Small value" assumption doesn't hold against sophisticated MEV strategies
2. Implementation of proper protections is standard practice and well-documented
3. The risk/reward ratio heavily favors adding protection
4. Current design violates core DeFi security principles
5. Protocol growth will only increase the severity of this issue

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing the following. 

1. Remove the unlimited Slippage Allowance.
2. Implement user-specified deadlines.
3. Add safety checks for larger transactions.
