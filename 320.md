# `LendingAssetVault` can be drained by anyone

## Summary
The `withdraw` method in `LendingAssetVault` does not perform a 0-share check, allowing any withdrawal to pass without burning any shares as long as the requested amount is lower than the value of a single share.
## Description
Let's observe the `convertToShares` method used in `withdraw` 
```solidity
    function convertToShares(uint256 _assets) public view override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _shares = (_assets * PRECISION) / _cbr();
    }
```
The `_cbr` method determines the asset-per-share with precision of 1e27. Let's assume that there are 1e18 shares and 100e18 assets, asset-per-share is 100 and `_cbr = 100e27`

If we submit a withdraw with `_assets = 99` then `_shares = (99 * 1e27) / 100e27 = 99e27/100e27 = 0` due to solidity rounding down. Execution will continue with `shares = 0` and we go in `_withdraw` where [no 0-value checks are performed either](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L184).
```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 _shares, uint256 _assets, address _owner, address _caller, address _receiver) internal {
        if (_caller != _owner) {
            _spendAllowance(_owner, _caller, _shares);
        }
        uint256 _totalAvailable = totalAvailableAssets();
        _totalAssets -= _assets;


        require(_totalAvailable >= _assets, "AV");
        _burn(_owner, _shares); // @note no sanity checks
        IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_receiver, _assets);
        emit Withdraw(_owner, _receiver, _receiver, _assets, _shares);
    }
```
Everything passes and attacker receives the funds. Attacker repeats this until the vault is drained or until `_cbr = 1e27` and attacker has no valid inputs anymore since 1 wei of share will be worth 1 wei of asset.

The attack is still relevant even if ending up being unprofitable due to gas costs as it is still considered destruction of value without any external limitations. For example, stealing 100k USDC and incurring 120k USDC in costs is still a loss of 100k USDC for protocol users for a mere 20k USDC cost of doing business. 
## Impact
Direct loss of funds without limitations of external conditions
## Mitigation
Round up share conversion or perform a 0-value check on burnt shares.
