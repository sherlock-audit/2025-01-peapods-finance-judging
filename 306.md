# AutoCompundingLp doesnt confirm the whitelist/paused state of rewards before trying to convert them to assets

### Summary

_processRewardsToPodLp uses TokenRewards::getAllRewardTokens to determine which tokens it should attempt to swap to asset

The issue is getAllRewardTokens returns all assets that have ever been whitelisted and deposited whether or not they are still whitelisted or have been paused

this is the only point in which allRewardTokens is updated 
_processRewardsToPodLp does not  verify by itself  whether reward tokens are still whitelisted or paused before interacting with them. This oversight could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or other vulnerabilities if a reward token becomes malicious or compromised.


### Root Cause

The AutoCompoundingLp contract uses TokenRewards.getAllRewardsTokens() to retrieve all reward tokens that have ever been used as rewards, regardless of whether they are still whitelisted or paused. It does not verify the status of these tokens before interacting with them. This could lead to vulnerabilities if a reward token becomes malicious or compromised.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none 

### External Pre-conditions

reward token becomes compromised 

### Attack Path

A reward token used in the TokenRewards contract becomes compromised such that all its functions now revert on call (e.g., due to an upgradeable proxy token contract being hijacked).

The compromised token is dewhitelisted and paused in the TokenRewards contract.

A user deposits assets into the AutoCompoundingLp contract, triggering _processRewardsToPodLp.

The AutoCompoundingLp contract attempts to interact with the compromised token (e.g., by calling balanceOf), causing the transaction to revert.

The contract becomes temporarily unusable, and valid accrued rewards may be lost.

### Impact

Denial of Service (DoS): If a reward token is dewhitelisted or paused due to malicious behavior, attempts to interact with it could cause the AutoCompoundingLp contract to revert, temporarily disabling its functionality.

Reentrancy Risks: If a reward token is compromised and behaves maliciously (e.g., by reverting on balance checks or enabling reentrancy), it could reintroduce vulnerabilities similar to those described in C-08 of the Guardian report.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, the AutoCompoundingLp contract should verify that reward tokens are still whitelisted and not paused before interacting with them. This can be achieved by adding checks before processing rewards:
