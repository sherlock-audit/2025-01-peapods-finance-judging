# Interest rate manipulation through utilization rate allows forced liquidations of healthy positions

### Summary

The lack of utilization rate manipulation protection in FraxlendPairCore.sol will cause forced liquidations of healthy positions as malicious users can artificially spike interest rates by manipulating the utilization rate through large borrows, pushing positions that are close to their liquidation threshold into liquidation, even FraxlendPairCore implements block protection through minURChangeForExternalAddInterest, the interest rate can still be manipulated in edge cases when utilization rate changes exceed the minimum threshold, allowing for forced liquidations of positions near their limits.

### Root Cause

In FraxlendPairCore.sol:316-317:

```solidity
CopyInsert
uint256 _newUtilizationRate =
    _totalAssetsAvailable == 0 ? 0 : (UTIL_PREC * totalBorrow.amount) / _totalAssetsAvailable;
The utilization rate directly affects interest rates and is calculated as (totalBorrow / totalAssets) * UTIL_PREC. A malicious 
```

user can manipulate this by:

The issue stems from the ability to manipulate interest rates and perform liquidations in the same transaction, leaving no opportunity for position owners to react.The protection only prevents interest updates when the rate change is below a threshold. However, if an attacker can cause a large enough utilization change, the protection is bypassed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Positions must exist near the liquidation threshold
The current utilization rate must be non-zero
The pool must have enough liquidity to allow large borrows like using a flash loan 


### External Pre-conditions

Sufficient liquidity available for large borrows and Liquidation rewards > gas costs

### Attack Path

Identify positions near the liquidation threshold
Calculate required to borrow an amount to exceed minURChangeForExternalAddInterest
Execute large borrows causing significant utilization increase
Interest rate update triggers due to large change
Liquidate affected positions in the same transaction

### Impact

Borrowers lose collateral through unavoidable liquidations, Attacker profits from liquidation rewards with zero risk,No possible user defense due to atomic execution, this will be a great chance  for MEVs 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Require multiple blocks for large rate changes
