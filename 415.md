# The debond fee in an early withdrawal uses a small precision, opening the door for rounding issues.

### Summary

During locking and debonding, if we want to initiate a premature withdrawal, etc an early withdrawal, we will tax the user with a fee + 10% of the fee.

The fee is using 1e5 for 100%.

Let's say that the user has configured the index fund in such a way that the debond fee is 0.67% = the number of 67.

If we divide 67 by 10, the rounding will make the result 6 instead of 6.7, thus making the second fee a little bit less than intended and making the total fee 0.67% + 0.06%, instead of 0.67% + 0.067%.

### Root Cause

The low precision used for the second fee as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/PodUnwrapLocker.sol#L125-L126) and the early withdrawal functionality, opening the door for rounding issues as can be seen when dividing it by ten.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The debond fee needs to have a remainder

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Bob debonds and locks his pod tokens
2. Two days later, Bob needs those money urgently, which are the bug sum of $200k, so he decides to initiate an early withdrawal via `earlyWithdraw()`, but due to the rounding, the fee is going to be less, instead of the 0.677%, the fee will be a little less -> 0.67%,
which on $200k will be a difference of exactly $14, causing a loss to the protocol due to a smaller fee
Remember, this will happen on every single call to `earlyWithdrawal()` and will result in thousands of dollars of losses in the lifecycle of the dApp.

### Impact

0.677%  and 0.67% fee is more than 1% of a difference between the fees themselves, as well as more than $10 of losses results in a medium severity due to the constrains of the finding.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Account the precision losses when calculating the second fee in the early withdrawal process
