# USDT Collateral Handling Vulnerability in Leverage Workflow

### Summary

The use of `safeIncreaseAllowance` with USDT collateral will cause transaction failures for leverage position adjustments on Ethereum mainnet as users will be unable to modify existing positions when using USDT as collateral.

### Root Cause

In `LeveragePositionCustodian.sol:L19-25`:
```solidity
function borrowAsset(address _pair, uint256 _borrowAmount, uint256 _collateralAmount, address _receiver)
    external
    onlyOwner
{
    IERC20(IFraxlendPair(_pair).collateralContract()).safeIncreaseAllowance(_pair, _collateralAmount);
    IFraxlendPair(_pair).borrowAsset(_borrowAmount, _collateralAmount, _receiver);
}
```
The implementation uses OpenZeppelin's safeIncreaseAllowance which is incompatible with USDT's non-standard ERC20 implementation on Ethereum mainnet.

### Internal Pre-conditions

USDT must be configured as collateral in a Fraxlend pair
The existing allowance for the Fraxlend pair must be greater than zero
User attempts to adjust their leverage position (deposit additional collateral

### External Pre-conditions

Protocol must be deployed on Ethereum mainnet

### Attack Path

The user creates initial leverage position with USDT collateral (allowance 0 → X)
User attempts to add more collateral to an existing position
safeIncreaseAllowance tries to set allowance X → Y
USDT contract rejects non-zero allowance increase
Transaction reverts with "ERC20: failed to increase allowance"

### Impact

could block legitimate leverage operations when USDT is used as collateral, Will affect operations on the Ethereum main net where USDT is widely used

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the existing safeIncreaseAllowance call.
