# share prices can be manipulated to extract more assets than deposited causing Vault Insolvency

The [_cbr()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L204-L207) function calculates the **conversion rate between shares and assets**, but it **fails to account for scenarios where total supply is zero**, leading to potential **incorrect share price calculations**. The function is defined as follows:  

```solidity
function _cbr() internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 _supply = totalSupply();
    return _supply == 0 ? FACTOR : (FACTOR * totalAssets()) / _supply;
}
```
The issue arises because when `_supply == 0`, the function **hardcodes** [FACTOR (10ยนโธ)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L52) as the conversion rate, rather than correctly deriving it from actual vault assets. This means that if an attacker deposits a **tiny amount of assets when total supply is zero**, they can **mint an excessive number of shares at an inflated rate**. Later, when more assets are added to the vault, the attacker can **redeem a disproportionate share of total assets**, draining funds from legitimate users.  

## Impact
An attacker can **manipulate share prices to extract more assets than they deposited**, potentially leading to **vault insolvency and loss of user funds**.  

## Mitigation
Ensure `_cbr()` correctly calculates the share price based on **actual deposited assets**, even when the total supply is zero, by using a more accurate initialization formula.
