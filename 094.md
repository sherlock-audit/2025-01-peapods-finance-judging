# Pod creators can make unverified indexes publicly visible in UI without protocol verification

### Summary

The missing verification check in [IndexManager.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/IndexManager.sol#L9) will cause potential user exposure to unsafe or malicious pods as creators can make their [unverified](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/interfaces/IIndexManager.sol#L10) indexes visible in the UI without protocol team validation.
```solidity
struct IIndexAndStatus {
        address index; // aka pod
        address creator;
-->     bool verified; // whether it's a safe pod as confirmed by the protocol team
        bool selfLending; // if it's an LVF pod, whether it's self-lending or not
        bool makePublic; // whether it should show in the UI or not
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [IndexManager.sol:updateMakePublic()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/IndexManager.sol#L94) there is a missing check to verify that an index has been verified by the protocol team before allowing it to be made public in the UI. The function only checks that the caller is either the owner, authorized, or the creator, but does not enforce that `verified = true` before allowing `makePublic = true`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A pod creator needs to deploy a new index through `deployNewIndex()` to create an unverified index
2. The index's verified status needs to be false
3. The index's `makePublic` status needs to be false

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious actor creates a new index through [deployNewIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/IndexManager.sol#L30-L38) which starts as unverified
2. The actor calls [updateMakePublic(index, true)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/IndexManager.sol#L94-L99) on their unverified index
3. The index becomes visible in the UI despite not being verified by the protocol team
4. Users may interact with an unsafe or malicious index thinking it has been vetted

### Impact

Users of the protocol suffer potential exposure to unverified and potentially malicious indexes that appear in the UI without protocol validation.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a verification check in the updateMakePublic function
