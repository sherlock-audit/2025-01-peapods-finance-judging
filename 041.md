# MEV bots will steal from users due to an incorrectly manipulated value

### Summary

MEV bots will steal from users due to an incorrectly manipulated value

### Root Cause

Upon calling `Zapper::_zap()` to handle a transfer of a different token, we have the following code which is for a direct swap in a Uniswap V3 pool:
```solidity
else {
        _amountOut = _swapV3Single(_in, _getPoolFee(_poolInfo.pool1), _out, _amountIn, _amountOutMin);

}
```
The `_amountOutMin` is provided by the user as slippage. The issue is that upon calling `_swapV3Single()`, we have the following code:
```solidity
uint256 _finalSlip = _slippage[_v3Pool] > 0 ? _slippage[_v3Pool] : _defaultSlippage;
...
DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(_in, _out, _fee, _amountIn, (_amountOutMin * (1000 - _finalSlip)) / 1000, address(this));
```
As seen, the provided minimum amount is manipulated and decreased further.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User provides 100 tokens to swap and wants at least 90 in return
2. The 90 minimum tokens input is decreased by `_finalSlip` percentage, resulting in the user receiving less than what he provided

### Impact

Theft of funds from innocent users who have done nothing wrong

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not manipulate the value for users who provided a specific amount of minimum tokens to receive
