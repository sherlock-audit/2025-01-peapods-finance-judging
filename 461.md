# Being forced to trade via Uni V2 in `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` can result in loss of funds under certain conditions

### Summary

During autocompounding of LP tokens, we should trade the paired lp for pod from the Uni pool which has the most depth, etc. the highest liquidity, but in `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` as can be seen, we do that just from Uni v2 statically, which may be against our interest.

### Root Cause

The root cause is statically just trading into Uni v2 instead of checking its reserves against Uni v3 and deciding which of the two pools has the highest liquidity, so that the lowest price movement will occur when swapping paired vs pod token

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Having a Uni v3 counterpart of the pool with higher liquidity

### Attack Path

1. LP Tokens are being autocompounded via `deposit()`/`mint()` and `_processRewardsToPodLp()` is called. Inside of it, several nested functions leads us to `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp()` which makes the swap exclusively only from a Uni v2 pool. If the Uni v3 has bigger depth, this means that we use the pool with lower liquidity, thus incurring losses from the protocol as we can't switch to the Uni v3 pool.

### Impact

Loss of funds under certain conditions - medium

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check the reserves of both pools or preview the returned amount so that we get the best value for our swap.
