# Protocol assumes the same deployment on all chains on multiple occasions

### Summary

Protocol assumes the same deployment on all chains on multiple occasions

### Root Cause

In some contracts such as `Zapper`, we have a similar code such as the below:
```solidity
contract Zapper is IZapper, Context, Ownable {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    address constant STYETH = 0x583019fF0f430721aDa9cfb4fac8F06cA104d0B4;
    address constant YETH = 0x1BED97CBC3c24A4fb5C069C6E311a967386131f7;
    address constant WETH_YETH_POOL = 0x69ACcb968B19a53790f43e57558F5E443A91aF22;
    address constant V3_ROUTER = 0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564;
    ...
}
```
The protocol will be deployed on multiple different chains, thus we can not assume the same address on all of them, let's for example see the address of the `YETH` variable on Mode: https://modescan.io/address/0x1BED97CBC3c24A4fb5C069C6E311a967386131f7. As seen, it is a random EOA.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

2 paths:

- a simple revert
- contract matches the address and signature which can be abused and can lead to a theft of funds (especially if the contract is upgradeable). Furthermore, as Berachain is not deployed yet, a malicious user can deploy an address at the hardcoded addresses and abuse it that way

### Impact

2 possible impacts - either reverts or if the address is a contract matching the function signatures, then this can lead to impacts such as a protocol drain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not hardcode the addresses
