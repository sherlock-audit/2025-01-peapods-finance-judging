# AutoCompoundingPodLp::previewDeposit is not comply with ERC4626

### Root Cause

>previewDeposit MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be minted in a deposit call in the same transaction. I.e. deposit should return the same or more shares as previewDeposit if called in the same transaction.

As we can see in below code snippet totalAssets wouldn't refer to updated value and this causes
totalAssets is lower than actual value 

```solidity
    function previewDeposit(uint256 _assets) external view override returns (uint256 _shares) {
    @>>>    return _convertToShares(_assets, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    }

    function _convertToShares(uint256 _assets, Math.Rounding _roundDirection) internal view returns (uint256 _shares) {
    @>>>    return Math.mulDiv(_assets, FACTOR, _cbr(), _roundDirection);
    }

    function _cbr() internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _supply = totalSupply();
    @>>>    return _supply == 0 ? FACTOR : (FACTOR * totalAssets()) / _supply;
    }
```

when user's depositing transaction will be executed totalAssets will
be increased accordingly and this causes user gets less share in compare to the value which he/she
gets from previewDeposit and that is not based on ERC 4626 standard

```solidity

    function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
    @>>>    _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);
        _shares = _convertToShares(_assets, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
    }
```

### Impact

users get less share in compare to the value which they get from `AutoCompoundingPodLp::previewDeposit`

### Mitigation

Consider to simulate processing rewards
