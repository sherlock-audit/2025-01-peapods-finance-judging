# Incorrect Principal Tracking: vaultDeposits Reduced by Redeemed Interest

### Summary
`vaultDeposits` tracks the asset amount deposited but is reduced by the redeemed asset value (including interest) instead of the principal. This leads to incorrect tracking of remaining deposits.

### Vulnerability Details

When the owner deposits assets into an external vault, the contract records the principal by doing:

```solidity
function depositToVault(address _vault, uint256 _amountAssets) external onlyOwner {
    // ... (after updating metadata)
    IERC20(_asset).safeIncreaseAllowance(_vault, _amountAssets);
    uint256 _amountShares = IERC4626(_vault).deposit(_amountAssets, address(this));
    require(totalAvailableAssetsForVault(_vault) >= _amountAssets, "MAX");
    vaultDeposits[_vault] += _amountAssets;
    vaultUtilization[_vault] += _amountAssets;
    _totalAssetsUtilized += _amountAssets;
    emit DepositToVault(_vault, _amountAssets, _amountShares);
}
```
Here, `vaultDeposits[_vault]` is increased by `_amountAssets`. This value represents the principal that was originally deposited into the vault. However, when assets are redeemed (or withdrawn) from the vault, the redeemed amount may include accrued interest. 

Consider the redeem function

```solidity
function redeemFromVault(address _vault, uint256 _amountShares) external onlyOwner {
    _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
    _amountShares = _amountShares == 0 ? IERC20(_vault).balanceOf(address(this)) : _amountShares;
    uint256 _amountAssets = IERC4626(_vault).redeem(_amountShares, address(this), address(this));
    uint256 _redeemAmt = vaultUtilization[_vault] < _amountAssets ? vaultUtilization[_vault] : _amountAssets;
    vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _redeemAmt > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultDeposits[_vault] : _redeemAmt;
    vaultUtilization[_vault] -= _redeemAmt;
    _totalAssetsUtilized -= _redeemAmt;
    emit RedeemFromVault(_vault, _amountShares, _redeemAmt);
}
```
The call to `IERC4626(_vault).redeem(...)` returns `_amountAssets`, which is the total asset value redeemed from the vault. This value can be greater than the original deposit if interest has accrued.

The variable `_redeemAmt `is set as the minimum of `vaultUtilization[_vault]` and `_amountAssets`. This value represents the total assets that are being removed from the vault accounting.

```solidity
vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _redeemAmt > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultDeposits[_vault] : _redeemAmt;
```

The line subtracts the redeemed amount from vaultDeposits. This is where the problem occurs.

If interest has accrued, `_amountAssets `(and thus `_redeemAmt`) will be greater than the original principal. And by subtracting the entire `_redeemAmt`, the contract reduces `vaultDeposits` by not just the principal but also the earned interest

### Proof-Of-Concept
Imagine the following scenario:

1. 100 tokens are deposited into the vault. At this point: `vaultDeposits[_vault] = 100` and `vaultUtilization[_vault] = 100`
2.  Over time, the vault earns interest and the total asset value in the vault grows to 120 tokens.
3. When redeeming, suppose the vault returns 120 tokens (the 100 principal + 20 interest).
4. During redemption, `_amountAssets `becomes 120. The code sets `_redeemAmt `to 120 (assuming `vaultUtilization[_vault]` is at least 120). Then it subtracts from `vaultDeposits`
5. This results in `vaultDeposits[_vault]` becoming 100 - 100 = 0
   


### Impact
The bug directly affects how the principal is tracked. By reducing `vaultDeposits` using the full redeemed amount (including interest), the contract no longer accurately represents the original deposit amounts. This misrepresentation can lead to incorrect calculations in functions that depend on the principal balance, such as `totalAvailableAssetsForVault`.

### Recommendation
If the goal is to maintain an accurate record of the principal (i.e., the original deposits), then the redeemed interest should be handled separately from `vaultDeposits`, ensuring that only the principal amount is reduced upon redemption
