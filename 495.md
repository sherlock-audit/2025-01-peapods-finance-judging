# FraxlendPair is not EIP4626 compliant


### Summary

FraxlendPair is not EIP4626 compliant.

### Root Cause

First, the README explicitly states ERC4626 should be complied to:

> Q: Is the codebase expected to comply with any specific EIPs?
> 
> Many of our contracts implement ERC20 and ERC4626 which we attempt to comply with in the entirety of those standards for contracts that implement them.

According to the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626,

1. `maxDeposit` and `maxMint` should always return uint256.max if there is no limit.

> MUST return 2 ** 256 - 1 if there is no limit on the maximum amount of shares that may be minted.

> MUST return 2 ** 256 - 1 if there is no limit on the maximum amount of assets that may be deposited.

However, even though `depositLimit` is set to uint256.max [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairAccessControl.sol#L46), the return value of the two functions does not return uint256.max, but subtracts the current asset balance instead.

```solidity
    function maxDeposit(address) public view returns (uint256 _maxAssets) {
        (,,,, VaultAccount memory _totalAsset,) = previewAddInterest();
        _maxAssets =
            _totalAsset.totalAmount(address(0)) >= depositLimit ? 0 : depositLimit - _totalAsset.totalAmount(address(0));
    }

    function maxMint(address) external view returns (uint256 _maxShares) {
        (,,,, VaultAccount memory _totalAsset,) = previewAddInterest();
        uint256 _maxDeposit =
            _totalAsset.totalAmount(address(0)) >= depositLimit ? 0 : depositLimit - _totalAsset.totalAmount(address(0));
        _maxShares = _totalAsset.toShares(_maxDeposit, false);
    }
```

### Impact

1. Integrators may have trouble integrating as ERC4626.

### Mitigation

If depositLimit == uint256.max, return uint256 for `maxDeposit()` and `maxMint()` functions.
