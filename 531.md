# Flash Loan exploitation

#### Issue Description
Leverage operations in the protocol rely on oracles to determine prices. If an attacker manipulates prices during a flash loan, they can distort positions, leading to incorrect liquidations or excessive borrowing.

#### Impact
Flash loan attacks can cause cascading failures in the protocol, including bad debt accumulation and loss of user funds. The protocol's design assumes the existence of arbitrage bots to maintain market stability, but this assumption may not hold under adversarial conditions.

#### Proof of Concept
1. An attacker initiates a flash loan to borrow a large amount of liquidity.
2. They manipulate the price of a token pair in a lending pool.
3. The protocol's oracle reads the manipulated price, allowing the attacker to borrow more than intended or avoid liquidation.
4. The attacker repays the flash loan, profiting from the discrepancy.

#### Recommendation
Implement stricter validation for oracle readings, such as requiring multiple sources or increasing the TWAP interval. Additionally, enforce slippage tolerance checks to mitigate the impact of price manipulation.

```solidity
// Enforce minimum 0.5% slippage tolerance
if (_amountOutMin == 0) {
    _amountOutMin = (expectedAmountOut * 995) / 1000;
}
```
