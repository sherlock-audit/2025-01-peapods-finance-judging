# Book keeping error in `FraxlenPairCore::_depositFromVault` leading to artificial inflation of `totalAssets`

## Impact
### Summary 
The `FraxlenPairCore::_depositFromVault` function deposits assets from the external vault if available to the `FraxlendPairCore` contract. However, the function increments the number of assets and shares when in fact, no new assets are added to the total assets in the protocol disrupting the protocol's book keeping.

### Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `FraxlenPairCore::_depositFromVault` function calls the `FraxlenPairCore::_deposit` function which updates the `totalAssets` struct by incrementing `totalAssets.amount` and `totalAssets.shares`.

This vulnerability can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L643-L658) or by taking a look at the code snippet below. 

```javascript
       /// @notice The ```_depositFromVault``` function deposits assets here from the configured external vault if available
    /// @param _amount The amount of Asset Tokens to be transferred from the vault
    /// @return _sharesReceived The number of Asset Shares (fTokens) to mint for Asset Tokens
    function _depositFromVault(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256 _sharesReceived) {
        // Pull from storage to save gas
        VaultAccount memory _totalAsset = totalAsset;


        // Calculate the number of fTokens to mint
        _sharesReceived = _totalAsset.toShares(_amount, false);


        // Withdraw assets from external vault here
        externalAssetVault.whitelistWithdraw(_amount);


        // Execute the deposit effects
657:        _deposit(_totalAsset, _amount.toUint128(), _sharesReceived.toUint128(), address(externalAssetVault), false);
    } 

```


### Impact
Since the `FraxlendPairCore::_deposit` function increments the `totalAssets` struct without any real addition of assets into the protocol, the `totalAssets` now differs from the actual amount of assets in the protocol. The `totalAssets` is now inflated.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider modifying the `FraxlenPairCore::_depositFromVault` so that the `totalAssets` struct is not modified since there is no new addition of assets into the protocol.

```diff
    /// @notice The ```_depositFromVault``` function deposits assets here from the configured external vault if available
    /// @param _amount The amount of Asset Tokens to be transferred from the vault
    /// @return _sharesReceived The number of Asset Shares (fTokens) to mint for Asset Tokens
    function _depositFromVault(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256 _sharesReceived) {
        // Pull from storage to save gas
        VaultAccount memory _totalAsset = totalAsset;


        // Calculate the number of fTokens to mint
        _sharesReceived = _totalAsset.toShares(_amount, false);


        // Withdraw assets from external vault here
        externalAssetVault.whitelistWithdraw(_amount);


        // Execute the deposit effects
-        _deposit(_totalAsset, _amount.toUint128(), _sharesReceived.toUint128(), address(externalAssetVault), false);
    }
```
