# Incorrect refund logic in `_addLeveragePostCallback` leads to potential fund misallocation

### Summary

The incorrect refund logic in `_addLeveragePostCallback` will cause a financial loss for the NFT operator as the remaining funds after flash loan repayment are always sent to the position NFT owner instead of the actual fund provider. This issue arises when the operator, rather than the owner, supplies the funds for leverage.

### Root Cause

In `_addLeveragePostCallback`, the refund is sent to `positionNFT.ownerOf(_props.positionId)`, assuming the owner is always the borrower. However, the borrower is the `msg.sender` in `addLeverage`, which may be an operator of the NFT rather than the actual owner. If the operator provides funds, they will not receive any refund, leading to unintended financial losses.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An operator of an NFT position (not the owner) calls `addLeverage` and provides `_userProvidedDebtAmt` to reduce the flash loan amount.
2. The leveraged position generates excess funds after repaying the flash loan.
3. The contract incorrectly sends the excess funds to the position NFT owner instead of the operator who supplied them.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. An operator of a position NFT calls `addLeverage` with `_userProvidedDebtAmt` to reduce the flash loan amount.
2. The contract processes the leverage, repays the flash loan, and determines the remaining funds.
3. Instead of refunding the remaining funds to the actual fund provider (the operator), the contract sends them to the NFT owner.
4. The operator suffers an unintended financial loss as they do not receive the refund of their own contributed funds.

### Impact

The NFT operator suffers a financial loss proportional to the remaining funds after flash loan repayment, as they are incorrectly sent to the NFT owner. The NFT owner gains an unintended financial benefit if they are not the actual fund provider.
