# Lockup period for user takes effect on all user stakes when user adds more stakes in Voting.sol

### Summary

The stake function allows users to stake an asset. However, when a user stakes additional tokens after the owner modifies the lockup period, all previous stakes become subject to the new lockup period. This behavior can be problematic for users expecting to withdraw their original stakes based on the lockup duration that was in effect when they initially staked.

### Root Cause

```solidity
 function stake(address _asset, uint256 _amount) external override {
        require(_amount > 0, "A");
        IERC20(_asset).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
        stakes[_msgSender()][_asset].lastStaked = block.timestamp;
@>        stakes[_msgSender()][_asset].lockupPeriod = lockupPeriod;
        _updateUserState(_msgSender(), _asset, _amount);
        emit AddStake(_msgSender(), _asset, _amount);
    }
```

The function updates the lockup period with the global lockupPeriod variable, this overrides the previous stake lock period and set the current global lockup period as the new lock up period.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Users who stake under a short lockup period may find their funds inaccessible for a longer duration if they add more tokens after the owner increases the lockup.

Users expect each stake to retain its original lockup period instead of being overwritten by subsequent stakes.

### PoC

Scenario:
Initial Stake:

User stakes 100 tokens with a 7-day lockup (lockupPeriod = 7 days).

Lockup Period Update:
Owner updates lockupPeriod to 14 days.

User Adds More Tokens:
User stakes 50 more tokens.
The existing 100 tokens now inherit the 14-day lockup, even though they were initially staked under a 7-day period.

### Mitigation

Modify the contract to store a separate lockup period for each stake instead of overriding it globally.
