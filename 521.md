# Debond fee is counted multiple times in price oracle

### Summary

Debond fee is counted multiple times in price oracle

### Root Cause

In [spTKNMinimalOracle contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L170), functions count the debond fee for the correct price calculation.

```solidity
   function _calculateBasePerPTkn(uint256 _price18) internal view returns (uint256 _basePerPTkn18) {
        // pull from UniV3 TWAP if passed as 0
        if (_price18 == 0) {
            bool _isBadData;
            (_isBadData, _price18) = _getDefaultPrice18(); // USDC / WETH = 3000e18 USDC
            if (_isBadData) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        _basePerPTkn18 = _accountForCBRInPrice(pod, underlyingTkn, _price18);  

        // adjust current price for spTKN pod unwrap fee, which will end up making the end price
        // (spTKN per base) higher, meaning it will take more spTKN to equal the value
        // of base token. This will more accurately ensure healthy LTVs when lending since
        // a liquidation path will need to account for unwrap fees
&>      _basePerPTkn18 = _accountForUnwrapFeeInPrice(pod, _basePerPTkn18); // @audit it's not needed because weighted index is always substract that amount in convertAssets call
    }
```

But it's actually counted in `_accountForCBRInPrice` internal call because `_accountForCBRInPrice` function calls `convertToAssets` function in pTKN contract and it substract the debond fee in here. Due to this problem spTKN/base value will be calculated lesser than actual. 

Therefore, aspTKN/base value will be also wrong.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

No need

### Impact

aspTKN/base will be less than actual and it will make some liquidateable positions to can't be liquidated. Liquidation is time-sensitive function and it should liquidate the position at correct price.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not count the debond fee double times
