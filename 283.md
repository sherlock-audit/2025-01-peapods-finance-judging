# Incorrect Swap Calculation Due to Using V2 Reserve Logic for V3 Pools

### Summary
The `_getSwapAmt` function employs Uniswap V2 pool reserve logic (using `getReserves`) to compute the optimal one-sided swap amount. However, if the actual pool is a Uniswap V3 pool with concentrated liquidity, the function will receive and process data that does not represent the true liquidity distribution, leading to incorrect swap amount calculations.

### Vulnerability
The function calls:

```solidity
(uint112 _r0, uint112 _r1) = DEX_ADAPTER.getReserves(DEX_ADAPTER.getV2Pool(_t0, _t1));
```

This assumes a Uniswap V2-style pool interface, which provides straightforward reserve values used in the constant product formula (`x * y = k`).


Uniswap V3 pools do not maintain reserves in the same way as V2 pools. They employ concentrated liquidity, meaning liquidity is not uniformly distributed across all prices. The V3 pool's key parameters are accessed via `slot0()` and liquidity-specific data, which are not captured by `getReserves()`. Therefore, using V2 reserve logic in this context will produce inaccurate swap amounts.

### Impact

- The computed swap amount may not be optimal for the actual liquidity conditions, potentially leading to higher slippage.
- If the calculated amounts do not meet required thresholds or slippage limits, transactions might revert.
- Inefficient swaps can lead to poor pricing and reduce yield, affecting users negatively.
