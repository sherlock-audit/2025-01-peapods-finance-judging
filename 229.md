# `mint` and `withdraw` round towards the user possibly causing insolvency

### Summary

`mint` and `withdraw` round towards the user inside both `AutoCompoundingPodLp` and `LendingAssetVault`

### Root Cause

`mint` would round the user required assets down, meaning that for the same amount of shares less assets would be required.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L120-L124
```solidity
    function mint(uint256 _shares, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _assets) {
        _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(address(0));

        // shares * cbr / 1e27
        _assets = convertToAssets(_shares);
        _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
    }
```

Note that the same is with `withdraw` where the user shares burned are rounded down.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L136-L140
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _assets, address _receiver, address _owner) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(address(0));

        // shares = assets * 1e27 / cbr
        _shares = convertToShares(_assets);
        _withdraw(_shares, _assets, _owner, _msgSender(), _receiver);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

There is no attack path, this issue will appear with every mint/withdraw.

Example scenario would be:
1. If cbr is 0.9 200 shares will require `200 * 9 / 10 = 180` assets
2. User can call mint with 201 shares  and pay `201 * 9 / 10 = 180.9` which would round down to 180 assets.

### Impact

`mint` and `withdraw` round towards the user, possibly causing insolvency


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Always round towards the system, in the aforementioned functions consider rounding up. in order to charge the user more assets inside `mint` and burn more shares inside `withdraw`.
