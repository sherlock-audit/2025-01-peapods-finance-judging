# Buy Fee Bypass via Aerodrome Router's Zap Functionality

### Summary

look at this line of code in the DecentralizedIndex._update function 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L161C9-L161C58
```solidity
        bool _buy = _from == V2_POOL && _to != V2_ROUTER;
```
this entails that any transfer of tokens from the pool to another address that is not the router should incur buy fee charges (unless of course it is a call to removeLiquidity as this can be done with DecentralizedIndex::removeLiquidityV2 which pauses fees), swaps however are meant to incur fees when the recipient of the pod tokens is not the router.
The routers ie uniswap, camelot and aerodrome dont not use a receive and send mechanism, ie when swapping, they do not first receive tokens to themselves before sending the tokens to the reciepient, rather they pass the recipient directly to the pool which means the condition for buy fee being applied would pass since _to is not the router in _update 
The issue in aerodrome  router lies in a functionality that the other two do not have ie zap, this allows user to claim liquidity in one token and also allows user to claim all of said token inside the router contracts 
https://github.com/aerodrome-finance/contracts/blob/a5fae2e87e490d6b10f133e28cc11bcc58c5346a/contracts/Router.sol#L640-L646

```solidity
    function zapOut(
        address tokenOut,
        uint256 liquidity,
        Zap calldata zapOutPool,
        Route[] calldata routesA,
        Route[] calldata routesB
    ) external {
```

A user could take advantage of this by swapping to pod tokens with the router as the receiver (bypassing buy fee)
then on the router zap out the tokens sent there 
since the default fee on every transfer (0.01%) would likely be much smaller than the buy fee which is maxes at 20%, the user is incentivized to take this route bypassing the fee 

### Root Cause

buy fee conditionality ie allowing buy free transfer when the receiver is the router when there is really no reason for this, the main functionalities of the router are to add liquidity, remove liquidity and swap 
Both add and remove liquidity can be done feeless as allowed by the protocol 
swaps on the other hand are meant to incur fees and since the routers dont use and receive then send method, tokens dont go to the router at all during the swap process, the only way for tokens to reach the router after a swap is if the user is donating tokens there 

### Internal Pre-conditions

use of aerodrome adapter which uses the standard aerodrome v2 router 
non zero buy fee

### External Pre-conditions

none 

### Attack Path

1. user deposit some liquidity to the pool via Decentralizedndex::addLiquidityV2 if they dont have liquidity already 
2. The userscalls swap with the pod token as the tokenOut and the router as the recipient on the v2pool (this could also be done via the router but doing it via the pool is more gas efficient for the user to use the pool directly) - this would send the pod tokens to the router 
3. call zapOut on the router with token0ut specified as the pod token 

### Impact

the buy fee is meant to be used as 
fees for lp stakers ie lp stakers who keep the v2 pool running  will end up receiving less fees 
profit for pod owners 
fees to the partner

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

remediate the code to 
```solidity
        bool _buy = _from == V2_POOL ;
```
