# DoS of operations in `AutoCompoundingPodLp` due to not considering the deposit limit

### Summary

DoS of operations in `AutoCompoundingPodLp` due to not considering the deposit limit

### Root Cause

Upon operations such as depositing and withdrawing in `AutoCompoundingPodLp`, we have the following code:
```solidity
if (IS_PAIRED_LENDING_PAIR) {
                _amountOut = _depositIntoLendingPair(_pairedLpToken, _swapOutputTkn, _amountOut);
            }
```
Which calls this:
```solidity
function _depositIntoLendingPair(address _lendingPair, address _pairAsset, uint256 _depositAmt) internal returns (uint256 _shares) {
        IERC20(_pairAsset).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(_lendingPair), _depositAmt);
        _shares = IFraxlendPair(_lendingPair).deposit(_depositAmt, address(this));
    }
```
However, the code fails to consider the deposit limit in `FraxlendPair`:
```solidity
if (depositLimit < _totalAsset.totalAmount(address(0)) + _amount) revert ExceedsDepositLimit();
```
As the function is called upon all important operations, this will cause a DoS of depositing and withdrawing if the deposit limit is reached and if `IS_PAIRED_LENDING_PAIR` is true.
### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Rewards are processed for `AutoCompoundingPodLp` and `IS_LENDING_PAIR` is true
2. Upon depositing, we revert as the deposit limit has been reached
3. Users who try to withdraw will be DoSed for an indefinite amount of time
### Impact

DoS of functionalities such as deposits and withdraws

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check for the deposit limit and if it has been reached, do not deposit
