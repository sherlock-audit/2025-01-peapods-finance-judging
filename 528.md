# All the paused reward tokens will be stuck in contract

### Summary

All the paused reward tokens will be stuck in contract

### Root Cause

In [Token Rewards Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L236), distribution is happening before every function call and before distribution the contract checks the reward token is paused or not by the authority. 

```solidity
    function _distributeReward(address _wallet) internal {
        if (shares[_wallet] == 0) {
            return;
        }
        for (uint256 _i; _i < _allRewardsTokens.length; _i++) {
            address _token = _allRewardsTokens[_i];

            if (REWARDS_WHITELISTER.paused(_token)) {
                // @audit at paused state rewards will be locked, if he remove some shares
                continue;
            }
```

If some tokens are paused for distribution and if the claimer doesn't hold SP token anymore, the tokens are permenantly locked in the contract. Because after setting the shares of the wallet owner to zero, it will be impossible to recover that reward tokens back even if it's unpaused back.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  SP owner wants to claim his LP tokens and rewards from the pool

### External Pre-conditions

1. A reward token should be paused by the authority

### Attack Path

1. Alice holds some SP token and she has some rewards in rewards contract
2. She wants to claim her rewards and get back the liquidity tokens ( v2 pool tokens ). 
3. A reward token is paused by the authority for some time
4. After claiming and redeeming the rewards are permanently locked in the contract.

### Impact

Loss of funds for the wallet owner

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Handle paused tokens with another algorithm
