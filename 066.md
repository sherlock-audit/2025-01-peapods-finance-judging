# The `TokenRewards::depositRewards` is vulnerable to sandwich attack via staking and unstaking leading to unfair rewards distribution

### Summary

The `StakingPool::stake` function allows to users to stake their LP tokens and `StakingPool::unstake` allows them to unstake. However, this functionality is vulnerable to a malicious user staking just before rewards are deposited via `TokenRewards::depositRewards` and unstaking right after, effectively claiming a part of the deposited rewards and stealing rewards from long-term and honest stakers.


### Root Cause

The protocol distributes rewards based on current staking positions without any time-based vesting or lockup period. This allows users to temporarily stake large amounts to capture disproportionate rewards.
Staking:

Unstaking:

### Internal Pre-conditions

 - StakingPoolToken must have existing stakers
 - TokenRewards contract must be ready to distribute rewards
 - No minimum staking period implemented


### External Pre-conditions

 - Ability to monitor mempool for incoming reward distributions
 - Sufficient capital to execute large stakes


### Attack Path

1. Monitor mempool for `TokenRewards.depositRewards` transactions
2. Front-run with large stake:
```solidity
vm.startPrank(attacker);
stakingToken.approve(address(stakingPool), largeAmount);
stakingPool.stake(attacker, largeAmount);
```
3. Reward distribution occurs:
```solidity
tokenRewards.depositRewards(rewardToken, rewardAmount);
```
4. Back-run with unstake:
```solidity
stakingPool.unstake(largeAmount);
tokenRewards.claimReward(attacker);
vm.stopPrank();
```


### Impact

1. Honest long-term stakers lose significant portions of rewards
2. Reduced incentive for legitimate long-term staking
3. Protocol's reward distribution mechanism becomes ineffective


### PoC

Initial State:
```solidity
// Honest Staker (staking for months)
Staked Amount: 100,000 LP tokens
Total Staked in Protocol: 100,000 LP tokens

// Weekly Reward
50,000 PEAS tokens scheduled for distribution
```

1. Attacker monitors mempool and sees reward distribution transaction:
```solidity
tokenRewards.depositRewards(PEAS, 50_000e18)
```

2. Front-run: Attacker stakes 1,000,000 LP tokens
```solidity
New Total Staked = 1,100,000 LP tokens
Attacker's Share = ~91% (1_000_000/1_100_000)
Honest Staker's Share = ~9% (100_000/1_100_000)
```

3. Reward Distribution
```solidity
50,000 PEAS distributed according to shares:
- Attacker receives: 45,454 PEAS (91%)
- Honest staker receives: 4,546 PEAS (9%)
```

4. Back-run: Attacker unstakes 1,000,000 LP tokens
```solidity
- Claims 45,454 PEAS
- Honest stakers who staked for months gets only 4,546 PEAS
```


### Mitigation

Here are a few mitigation options:
1. Implement minimum staking period lock
2. Add vesting period for rewards
3. Calculate rewards based on time-weighted position size
