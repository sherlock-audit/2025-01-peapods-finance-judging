# Slippage Risk in _tokenToPairedLpToken Function

### Summary:
- The `_tokenToPairedLpToken` function exposes users to slippage risk during token swaps.
- The function lacks a defined minimum output (_amountOutMin) in certain swaps, especially for non-rewards tokens.

**Severity: Medium**
**Impact: Medium**
**Likelihood: Medium** 

### Affected Line Of Code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L249-L301

```solidity
_amountOut = _swap(_token, _swapOutputTkn, _amountIn, 0);
...
try DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(
    _rewardsToken,
    _swapOutputTkn,
    REWARDS_POOL_FEE,
    _amountIn,
    0, // _amountOutMin can be 0 because this is nested inside of function with LP slippage provided
    address(this)
) returns (uint256 __amountOut)
```

### Finding Description:
- **Issue:** The function allows token swaps with _amountOutMin set to 0, leading to possible significant slippage.
- **Security Breakdown:** No fail-safe or minimum output check for token swaps, which could result in the user receiving fewer tokens than expected due to price fluctuations.
- **Propagation:** If the market fluctuates significantly, this slippage could lead to financial loss.

### Impact Explanation:
- This issue does not allow immediate exploits or breaches.
- The vulnerability poses a risk of financial loss through slippage, especially in volatile or low-liquidity conditions.

### Likelihood Explanation:
- The likelihood of slippage is higher in volatile markets or low-liquidity conditions.
- In normal trading environments, this risk is less likely to occur.


### Recommendation:
- **Fix:** Introduce a minimum output parameter (_amountOutMin) for all token swaps to protect against excessive slippage:

```solidity
uint256 _slippageTolerance = 5; // Example: 5% slippage tolerance
uint256 _amountOutMin = (_amountIn * (100 - _slippageTolerance)) / 100;

_amountOut = _swap(_token, _swapOutputTkn, _amountIn, _amountOutMin);
```
- **Benefit:** This ensures that users only receive a swap if the output meets a minimum threshold, thus preventing significant losses from slippage.
