# User can bypass pTKN debondFees.


### Summary

User can bypass pTKN debondFees.

### Root Cause

The debond fee logic check if the amount of debond shares is larger than 99% of the total supply, and don't take any debond fees if it is larger.

A vector to bypass debond fee is to bond a bunch of underlyingTKN to inflate his pTKN shares to >=99% of total supply, and debond them all at once. This way the debond fee can be avoided.

For example, if bondFee=0%, debondFee=10%, totalSupply=100, userShares=10. User can bond 10000 shares, so he takes up 10010/10100=99.1% >= 99%, and debond them all at once to bypass debondFees.

```solidity
    function debond(uint256 _amount, address[] memory, uint8[] memory) external override lock noSwapOrFee {
@>      uint256 _amountAfterFee = _isLastOut(_amount) || REWARDS_WHITELIST.isWhitelistedFromDebondFee(_msgSender())
            ? _amount
            : (_amount * (DEN - _fees.debond)) / DEN;
        ...
    }
```

```solidity
    function _isLastOut(uint256 _debondAmount) internal view returns (bool) {
@>      return _debondAmount >= (_totalSupply * 99) / 100;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- User would need have access to a lot of underlyingTKNs. He can even try to flashloan them flashloaning is cheaper.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

User bonds a bunch of shares until he reaches 99% of totalSupply and can debond for free.

### Impact

User bypasses debond shares.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Not sure how to fix this without changing the design. Maybe consider always taking debond fees.
