# Malicious actor can front-run LVF position transfer to devalue It

### Summary

The Peapods protocol introduces Leverage Volatility Farming (LVF), enabling users to create positions represented as NFTs. These positions can be transferred or traded on secondary markets. A malicious actor can front-run a transfer transaction by removing the leverage before the ownership transfer is finalized, thereby devaluing the position.

### Root Cause

[`LeveragePositions`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeveragePositions.sol#L7-L23) lack a time-lock mechanism to prevent immediate transfers after their state has changed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

LVF position is created.

### External Pre-conditions

Victim initiates a buy transaction.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates an LVF position.  
2. The attacker lists the position (NFT) for sale on the marketplace.  
3. The victim notices the offer and initiates a buy transaction.  
4. The attacker detects the pending transaction and front-runs it, removing leverage from the position.  
5. The victimâ€™s transaction executes successfully, purchasing the NFT.  
6. The attacker regains their initial pTKN, while the victim is left with a worthless NFT.  

### Impact

This issue creates an opportunity for fraudulent activity. The victim unknowingly purchases an NFT with no actual value, leading to a direct financial loss.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a delay between leverage modifications and position transfers. Once leverage is changed, restrict selling or transferring the position for a predefined period.
