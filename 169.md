# Bad data would DOS the whole `AutoCompoundingPodLp`

### Summary


Division by 0 would DOS half of the system and cause bad debt accrual inside frax lending

### Root Cause

`getPodPerBasePrice`, used inside the main flow in `AutoCompoundingPodLp` (`_processRewardsToPodLp` -> `_tokenToPodLp` -> `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` ) has one critical flaw - it can devide by 0, leading to a revert:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L104-L106
```solidity
    function getPodPerBasePrice() external view override returns (uint256 _pricePTknPerBase18) {
        _pricePTknPerBase18 = 10 ** (18 * 2) / _calculateBasePerPTkn(0);
    }
```

The issue appears as `_calculateBasePerPTkn` will return 0 when `_isBadData` is true:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L170-L186
```solidity
    function _calculateBasePerPTkn(uint256 _price18) internal view returns (uint256 _basePerPTkn18) {
        if (_price18 == 0) {
            bool _isBadData;
            (_isBadData, _price18) = _getDefaultPrice18();
            if (_isBadData) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
```

Where `_isBadData` can be multiple things, one of which is for the ChainLink oracleto have updated it's prices later than it's appointed `_maxDelay`, which happens more than often:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/spTKNMinimalOracle.sol#L188-L194
```solidity
    function _getDefaultPrice18() internal view returns (bool _isBadData, uint256 _price18) {
        (_isBadData, _price18) = IMinimalSinglePriceOracle(UNISWAP_V3_SINGLE_PRICE_ORACLE).getPriceUSD18(
            BASE_CONVERSION_CHAINLINK_FEED, underlyingTkn, UNDERLYING_TKN_CL_POOL, twapInterval
        );

        if (_isBadData) {
            return (true, 0);
        }
        //...
     }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/UniswapV3SinglePriceOracle.sol#L32
```solidity
    function getPriceUSD18(
        address _clBaseConversionPoolPriceFeed,
        address _quoteToken,
        address _quoteV3Pool,
        uint256 _twapInterval
    ) external view virtual override returns (bool _isBadData, uint256 _price18) {
        uint256 _quotePriceX96 = _getPoolPriceTokenDenomenator(_quoteToken, _quoteV3Pool, uint32(_twapInterval));
        // default base price to 1, which just means return only quote pool price without any base conversion
        uint256 _basePrice18 = 10 ** 18;
        uint256 _updatedAt = block.timestamp;

        if (_clBaseConversionPoolPriceFeed != address(0)) {
            (_basePrice18, _updatedAt, _isBadData) = _getChainlinkPriceFeedPrice18(_clBaseConversionPoolPriceFeed);
        }
        _price18 = (_quotePriceX96 * _basePrice18) / FixedPoint96.Q96;

        uint256 _maxDelay = feedMaxOracleDelay[_clBaseConversionPoolPriceFeed] > 0
            ? feedMaxOracleDelay[_clBaseConversionPoolPriceFeed]
            : defaultMaxOracleDelay;

        _isBadData = _isBadData || _updatedAt < block.timestamp - _maxDelay;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
1. One Chainlink oracle id down for one reason or another, or has is still late to update his fees (happens often, some proof - https://x.com/danielvf/status/1693617395292582261)
2. `_getDefaultPrice18` returns 0, leading to `getPodPerBasePrice` revert as it tries to divide by 0

```solidity
    function getPodPerBasePrice() external view override returns (uint256 _pricePTknPerBase18) {
        _pricePTknPerBase18 = 10 ** (18 * 2) / _calculateBasePerPTkn(0);
    }
```

3. The whole flow inside `AutoCompoundingPodLp` is bricked as it's main updater function reverts - `_processRewardsToPodLp`
4. LVF doesn't work and frax lend may accrue bad debt if this asset is used as collateral, as liquidators will not be able to acquire it to repay the borrower's debt and thus liquidate him.

### Impact

The whole `AutoCompoundingPodLp` is DOS, which means that the lvf is also bricked, potentially **pods** (if they have compounded podLP as part of their assets) and **frax lending contracts** if they are using compounded podLP for collateral/assets (which they are inside lvf).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of blocking the whole contract, rely on TWAP, or change the flow that if one oracle is bad the system would rely on the rest.

Another easy fix would be to just put the dangerous code into a try and stop the `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` flow, which won't impact anything, just pause the yield for some time (until everything is back to normal).
