# LeverageManager::_bondToPod for pods which has more than asset as a underlying token will be reverted

### Root Cause

Users can init position and then adding leverage but users should deposit their Pods Token into LeverageManager or deposit or add leverage through `LeverageManager::addLeverageFromTkn` and this function
wraps users' asset into pod token but there is problem here and that is `LeverageMananger::_bondToPod` just work for those Pods which has one underlying token

```solidity
    function _bondToPod(address _user, address _pod, uint256 _tknAmt, uint256 _amtPtknMintMin) internal {
        IDecentralizedIndex.IndexAssetInfo[] memory _podAssets = IDecentralizedIndex(_pod).getAllAssets();
@>>>        IERC20 _tkn = IERC20(_podAssets[0].token);
        uint256 _tknBalBefore = _tkn.balanceOf(address(this));
        _tkn.safeTransferFrom(_user, address(this), _tknAmt);
        uint256 _pTknBalBefore = IERC20(_pod).balanceOf(address(this));
        _tkn.approve(_pod, _tkn.balanceOf(address(this)) - _tknBalBefore);
        IDecentralizedIndex(_pod).bond(address(_tkn), _tkn.balanceOf(address(this)) - _tknBalBefore, _amtPtknMintMin);
        IERC20(_pod).balanceOf(address(this)) - _pTknBalBefore;
    }
```

### Internal Condition

there is a Pod token with TokenA and TokenB as underlying token with weight 50% for both

### PoC

When users want to call `LeverageManager::addLeverageFromTkn` to add leverage `LeverageManager::_bondToPod` just try to get TokenA from user 
but `WeightedIndex::bond` needs TokenB as well and this causes the transaction will be reverted

### Impact

break core functionalities

### Mitigation

consider to compute required amount for all tokens based on their weight
