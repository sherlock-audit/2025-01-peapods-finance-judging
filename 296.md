# Any user can force premature fee collection from V3 positions in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/V3Locker.sol#L22-L31

### Summary

Missing access control on the collect() function in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/V3Locker.sol#L22-L31 will cause a griefing risk for the owner as any user can trigger fee collection at suboptimal times.

### Root Cause

In V3Locker.sol:20 the collect() function lacks access control allowing any address to call it.


### Internal Pre-conditions

V3 position must have collected fees
Position must be owned by V3Locker contract

### External Pre-conditions

Uniswap V3 pool position must have accumulated fees (swap activity in pool)
Uniswap V3 NonFungiblePositionManager must be operational (not paused or frozen)

### Attack Path

Attacker monitors mempool for owner's intended collection transaction
Attacker front-runs owner's transaction with call to collect()
Fees are collected and sent to owner at suboptimal gas prices/timing
Owner's original transaction fails or reverts, wasting gas

### Impact

The owner suffers increased gas costs and loses control over fee collection timing. The attacker loses gas cost to execute the front-running (griefing).

### PoC

function testFrontRunCollect() public {
    // Setup V3 position and accrue fees
    uint256 tokenId = setupV3Position();
    
    // Attacker front-runs
    vm.prank(attacker);
    v3Locker.collect(tokenId); // Works despite not being owner
    
    // Owner's transaction now fails/wastes gas
    vm.prank(owner);
    v3Locker.collect(tokenId);
}

### Mitigation

Add onlyOwner modifier to collect() function:
function collect(uint256 _lpId) external onlyOwner {
    V3_POS_MGR.collect(...);
}
