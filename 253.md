# Unclaimed Rewards Lost Due to Inadvertent Reset for Paused Tokens

### Summary

In this vulnerability, when a token is paused and The function `setShares` is invoked thus triggering `_addShares`, the contract correctly skips distributing that token’s rewards in `_distributeReward`. However, it then calls `_resetExcluded` for all tokens (including the paused one), overwriting the user’s previously accumulated but undistributed reward data. This results in the permanent loss of those paused token rewards.

### Root Cause

The core issue arises because the contract unconditionally resets the `excluded` reward data for all tokens—regardless of whether a token is paused. Specifically, the logic in `_addShares` calls `_distributeReward`, which skips distributing rewards for paused tokens. However, the subsequent `_resetExcluded` call overwrites the user’s accumulated but undistributed reward data for those paused tokens, effectively causing the user to lose unclaimed rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

• The user already holds shares (`shares[_wallet] > 0`).
• A token has been paused via `setPaused(address _token, bool _isPaused)` .
• The function `setShares` is invoked, thus triggering `_addShares`  and subsequently `_distributeReward` `_resetExcluded`.

### Attack Path

1. An administrative call to `setPaused(address _token, bool _isPaused)` enables the paused state for a specific token.
2. A user with existing shares in the contract (meaning they have previously accrued some reward) triggers a call to `_addShares (for instance, staking more tokens)`.
3. Inside `_addShares`, the function `_distributeReward` is called, which checks if the token is paused and skips distributing rewards for that token if `REWARDS_WHITELISTER.paused(_token)` equals true.
4. Because the token is paused, no rewards are distributed, and the user’s pending reward for that token remains unclaimed.
5. Immediately afterward, `_resetExcluded` is invoked and unconditionally resets the user’s `excluded` value for all tokens, including the paused one. This action overwrites any previously accumulated but undistributed reward data for the paused token.
6. Consequently, the user permanently loses the unclaimed reward amount for the paused token.

### Impact

• Users lose all unclaimed rewards for paused tokens because the stored reward balances are overridden.
• This can lead to significant financial losses if a large or valuable quantity of tokens remains paused, then reset.

### Mitigation

Split out paused and unpaused tokens in `_resetExcluded` so paused tokens are not included in the reset process.
```solidity
 function _resetExcluded(address _wallet) internal { 
     for (uint256 _i; _i < _allRewardsTokens.length; _i++) { 
         if (REWARDS_WHITELISTER.paused(_token)) {
             continue;
         }
         address _token = _allRewardsTokens[_i]; 
         rewards[_token][_wallet].excluded = _cumulativeRewards(_token, shares[_wallet], true); 
     } 
 } 
```
