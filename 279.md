# Incorrect isLastOut Logic Allows Fee-Free Debonding

### Summary

The isLastOut function in the WeightedIndex contract is designed to allow users to withdraw their assets without paying a debond fee if they are the last ones exiting the pod. However, the current implementation incorrectly checks whether the user is withdrawing 99% of the total supply instead of the entire total supply. This flaw allows users to exploit the system by temporarily owning 99% of the total supply and debonding their assets fee-free.



```solidity
    function _isLastOut(uint256 _debondAmount) internal view returns (bool) {
        return _debondAmount >= (_totalSupply * 99) / 100;
    }
```

```solidity
        uint256 _amountAfterFee = _isLastOut(_amount) || REWARDS_WHITELIST.isWhitelistedFromDebondFee(_msgSender())
            ? _amount
            : (_amount * (DEN - _fees.debond)) / DEN;
```



### Root Cause

The root cause is the flawed logic in the isLastOut function:

```solidity
function _isLastOut(uint256 _debondAmount) internal view returns (bool) {
    return _debondAmount >= (_totalSupply * 99) / 100;
}
```
This function checks if the debond amount is greater than or equal to 99% of the total supply, rather than checking if the entire supply is being cleared. As a result, users can exploit this by bonding enough tokens to temporarily own 99% of the total supply and then debonding their assets without paying the debond fee.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The bond fee must be significantly lower than the debond fee.

The total supply of pod tokens should be relatively low to make the exploit cost-effective.

### External Pre-conditions
The user must have access to sufficient funds (either their own or via a flash loan) to temporarily own 99% of the total supply.
A fee free flashloan is preferred but as long as the flashloan fee amount + bond fee amount< debondFee amount, t would still be profitable for the user 

### Attack Path
A user bonds enough tokens to temporarily own 99% of the total supply. This can be done using their own funds or a fee-free flash loan (e.g., Morpho flash loan).

The user calls the debond function. Since the isLastOut condition is met (debond amount >= 99% of total supply), the user pays no debond fee.

The user repays the flash loan (if used) and retains their full assets, effectively bypassing the debond fee.



### Impact

Revenue Loss: The debond fee is a critical source of revenue for:

LP Stakers: Fees incentivize liquidity providers to support the pod.

Pod Owners: Fees contribute to the profitability of pod owners.

By bypassing the debond fee, the protocol loses a significant portion of its revenue.

Unfair Advantage: Users who exploit this loophole gain an unfair advantage over honest users who pay the full debond fee.

Economic Imbalance: The reduced fee revenue may lead to lower incentives for liquidity providers, potentially destabilizing the pod and harming the protocol's long-term sustainability.

### PoC

Assume the current total supply of pod tokens is 100,000, representing 120,000 USDC.

Bob owns 20,000 shares (24,000 USDC). The debond fee is 10%, so Bob would lose 2,400 USDC if he debonds normally.

Bob takes a fee-free flash loan (e.g., from Morpho) to mint 9.9 million shares (approximately 11,882,400 USDC at a bond fee of 0.02%).

The total supply is now 10,000,000 shares. Bob owns >99% of the total supply.

Bob debonds all his shares without paying any debond fee.

Bob repays the flash loan, paying a bond fee of 1,980.4 USDC.

Bob's net gain: 2,400 USDC (saved debond fee) - 1,980.4 USDC (bond fee) = 419.6 USDC.

This exploit becomes more profitable as the bond fee decreases relative to the debond fee and as the total supply of pod tokens decreases.

### Mitigation

modify isLastOut so that it is only triggered when the totalSupply is being cleared
