# create() is vulnerable to front running

### Summary

The create function allows users to create vaults with specific parameters
```solidity
function create(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, address _asset, uint96 _salt)
        external
        returns (address _vault)
    {
```
These values are visible on the mempool and could be front-run by malicious actors.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVaultFactory.sol#L20

The vulnerability arises due to the predictable nature of the salt parameter `_salt` used in the CREATE2 address computation. Since `_salt` is directly supplied by the caller and the function does not rely or use any dynamic, unpredictable factors (e.g., `block.timestamp`, or `msg.sender` an attacker can front run transactions to `create()` with exact parameters and higher gas fees ultimately now in control of the vault.

```solidity
function _getFullSalt(uint96 _salt) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return uint256(uint160(address(this))) + _salt;
    }
```


### Attack Path

1. Alice wants to deploy a vault using parameters `Doge` `dog` `0xAddressOfDogeToken` `234678889`
2. Attacker sees Alice's transaction on the mempool
3. Attacker sends a transaction with the exact same parameters (`Doge` `dog` `0xAddressOfDogeToken` `234678889`)
4. Attacker now owns vault address

### Impact

Front running transactions to `create` can lead to various security risks 

- `Funds Loss` – If users expect a vault at a known address, the attacker could deploy a malicious vault with `selfdestruct` functionality , call  `selfdestruct()` replace deployed vault with malicious code which can be used to drain user funds.
- `Stealing Alice’s Vault Name & Symbol` – The attacker can deploy a vault with the same branding(name and symbol), misleading users.
-  `DOS: Locking Out Legitimate Users` – If Alice intended to launch a vault at a specific CREATE2 address, she is now locked out of that address.


### PoC

```solidity
   function testcreateFrontRunning() public {
        address attacker = address(0x2);
        string memory VAULT_NAME = "Doge Vault";   //Alice wants to create Doge Vault.
        string memory VAULT_SYMBOL = "DOGE";
        uint96 SALT = 6;

        asset.transfer(attacker, 10000 * 10 ** 18);
        
        address expectedVault = factory.getNewCaFromParams(VAULT_NAME, VAULT_SYMBOL, address(asset), SALT);

        // Attacker front-runs the deployment
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        asset.approve(address(factory), 1000);
        address attackerVault = factory.create(VAULT_NAME, VAULT_SYMBOL, address(asset), SALT);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user);
        vm.expectRevert();  //user can no longer create vault due to collision error.
        factory.create(VAULT_NAME, VAULT_SYMBOL, address(asset), SALT);
        vm.stopPrank();
        assert(attackerVault == expectedVault );
        
    }
```

### Mitigation

Update `_getFullSalt()` to use a dynamic factors during computation of `_salt` such as `block.timestamp` or `msg.sender`
