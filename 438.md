# FraxlendPair user liquidation may be frontrun, leading to loss of funds.


### Summary

FraxlendPair user liquidation may be frontrun, leading to loss of funds.

### Root Cause

First we need to understand how Fraxlend liquidation works for bad debt.

For example, a position has `borrowedShares=borrowedAssets=100, collateral=100, exchangeRate(asset/collateral)=1.1`. This position is subject to liquidation, because the borrowed asset is worth 110, while collateral only worth 100. The process is as follow:

1. Liquidators specify the amount of shares he wants to liquidate (the `_sharesToLiquidate` parameter)
2. Calculate the amount of collateral the liquidator should get (the `_collateralForLiquidator` variable). This should be slightly higher in worth of the liquidated shares, since there is a liquidation bonus. However, if the position does not have that much collateral left, the leftover position collateral balance would be given to the liquidator.
3. If position has none collateral left, and there are still borrow shares left, it is written to bad debt.

Using the example above, if a liquidator chooses to liquidate `_sharesToLiquidate=80`, he would get `_collateralForLiquidator=88` (we ignore the liquidation bonus for simplicity).

However, if someone frontruns the liquidator and liquidates 20 shares, the frontrunner would get 22 collateral, and the original liquidator would only get the remainder collateral, which is 100-22=78. The original liquidator would still repay 80 shares, but only gets 78 collateral back, effectively losing funds.

```solidity
        {
            // Checks & Calculations
            // Determine the liquidation amount in collateral units (i.e. how much debt liquidator is going to repay)
@>          uint256 _liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits =
                ((_totalBorrow.toAmount(_sharesToLiquidate, false) * _exchangeRate) / EXCHANGE_PRECISION);

            // We first optimistically calculate the amount of collateral to give the liquidator based on the higher clean liquidation fee
            // This fee only applies if the liquidator does a full liquidation
            uint256 _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator =
                (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + cleanLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;

            // Because interest accrues every block, _liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits from a few lines up is an ever increasing value
            // This means that leftoverCollateral can occasionally go negative by a few hundred wei (cleanLiqFee premium covers this for liquidator)
            _leftoverCollateral = (_userCollateralBalance.toInt256() - _optimisticCollateralForLiquidator.toInt256());

            // If cleanLiquidation fee results in no leftover collateral, give liquidator all the collateral
            // This will only be true when there liquidator is cleaning out the position
@>          _collateralForLiquidator = _leftoverCollateral <= 0
                ? _userCollateralBalance
                : (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + dirtyLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;

            if (protocolLiquidationFee > 0) {
                _feesAmount = (protocolLiquidationFee * _collateralForLiquidator) / LIQ_PRECISION;
                _collateralForLiquidator = _collateralForLiquidator - _feesAmount;
            }
        }
```

Note that due to the existance of liquidation bonus, this issue can happen even if collateral worth is larger than borrowed asset worth.

Also, note that though there is a `deadline` parameter for liquidation, it cannot be used to prevent frontrunning.

### Internal pre-conditions

- A borrow position that is insolvent.

### External pre-conditions

- Liquidator gets frontrun.

### Attack Path

Attacker can frontrun the victim liquidator and liquidate the position first, leaving less collateral for the victim.

### Impact

Liquidator may end up with less collateral worth of the assets that he repayed, effectively losing funds.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add a slippage for the minimum amount of collateral the liquidator should receive.
