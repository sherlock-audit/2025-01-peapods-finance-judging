# Residual Token Inclusion in Paired LP Token Calculation Leads to Inaccurate Conversions

### Summary
`AutoCompoundingPodLP:_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` erroneously calculates the remaining paired LP tokens by using the total balance held by the contract instead of isolating the tokens received from the current swap. This flawed approach inadvertently includes residual tokens from previous operations, leading to inaccurate conversion amounts and potential liquidity addition errors


### Vulnerability Details
In the `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` function, the calculation for the remaining paired LP tokens is performed as follows:

```solidity
pairedRemaining = IERC20(_pairedLpToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - _protocolFees;
```

This line retrieves the entire balance of `_pairedLpToken` held by the contract and subtracts the protocol fees.

The use of `IERC20(_pairedLpToken).balanceOf(address(this))` fetches the contract's complete token balance, without distinguishing between tokens received from the current swap and any tokens carried over from previous transactions.

If the contract holds residual `_pairedLpToken` from earlier swaps or operations, these tokens will be included in the balance. For instance, if a prior swap left behind an excess amount and a new swap is performed, the new calculation will sum both amounts, thereby inflating `_pairedRemaining`.

The subtraction of `_protocolFees` only adjusts for fee-related deductions and does not isolate the delta specific to the current conversion, leading to further inaccuracies.

### Impact
This could cause unintended behavior in LP staking

### Tool Used
Manual review

### Recommendation
Before executing the swap, record the contract's balance of` _pairedLpToken`. After the swap, compute the delta to determine the exact amount received
