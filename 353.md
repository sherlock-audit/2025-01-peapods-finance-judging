# maxSwap is an insufficient solution to the asptkn donation issue

### Summary

In a previous audits, it was reported that the aspTKN oracle could be manipulated through a donation
of spTKN (see https://hackmd.io/@tapir/SyxqzohUA#H-9-aspTKN-oracle-can-be-manipulated).
and C-08 of the guardian audit linked in the readMe 

to counter this, the team included maxSwaps to reduce the amount of tokens that can be added to totalAssets in a single call 

There are three  issues here, each of high severity 
1. maxswap does just that , it only limits the attack for that call, the attack can still be done over multiple calls 

an example of this would be that the attacker donates the reward tokens they want to add to total assets to cause the inflation , and then calls deposit or mint multiple times each time minting dust eg ( 5 wei) of shares but adding the result amount  of a maxSwap to the totalAssets each time 
to accomplish their aim, the attacker would need to makes calls such that 
( amount of calls = amount donated / maxswap of donation reward token ) to completely increment total assets by the amount they initially wanted to causing the inflation each time only increasing the total supply by dust 

2. maxswap exposes previous depositor rewards to new depositors 

if only a part of the rewards (ie the maxSwap of the rewards are swapped to assets) then the remaining rewards in the assets would belong to all depositors including the new depositor despite the rewards being accrued by tokens staked by previous depositors since the next time totalAssets is incremented using this rewards, the new depositor would also have shares in the pool 

3. for maxSwap to work efficiently, it must be set for all tokens, including intermediate tokens in swaps, this could cause permanent loss of funds if the intermediate tokens are not reward tokens themselves 

however taking a look at the contract, if the intermediate token is not a reward token and amountOut of intermediate token received after the maxSwap is greater than the maxSwap of the intermediate token, then amountOut - maxSwap will be permanenly locked in the contract 

looking at the implementation for a two hop swap
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L380-L387

1.the pool would revert if amountOut is zero meaning the call would fail due to the pool reverting (this is very important for this issue)

2. since we have confirmed that intermediary balance will always be equal to amountOut before the maxSwap check , then we can also confirm that intermediary balance can never be greater than amount0ut ie intermediaryBalance only ever decreases to the maxSwap amount but would never increase past the amount received during the fist swap

this means that at any point ,amount only less and never more than amountOut can be used to swap to asset token
meaning the amountOut - maxSwap from previous swaps is never used and will forever be locked in the contract depleting user rewards 


### Root Cause

inclusion of maxSwaps for tokens to combat the donation issue 

### Internal Pre-conditions

issue 1 
none

issue 2 
none 

issue 3 
none 

### External Pre-conditions

issue 1 
the lendingVault is uses the asptkn oracle 

issue 2 
none 

issue 3 
none 


### Attack Path

issue 1
1. Attacker donates reward token amount such that when swapped will equal the amount they want to add to totalAssets 
2. Attacker calls mint with dust eg (1 wei) of shares supplied 
3. _processRewardsToPodLp is called which swaps maxSwap amount of result token and increments the totalAssets by the resulting asset token 
4. attacker does this over and over again until all reward tokens sent have been 

issue 2 
1. total amount of accrued usdc rewards  in the contract is 10_000 usdc but its maxswap is 8_000
2. new depositor calls deposit 
3. 8000 usdc is converted to assets and the new totalAssets is used to calculate the user shares 
4. new depositor  calls redeem for all his shares 
5. the remaining 2_000 usdc is added to assets and the user claims a part of it 


issue 3

A swap path is defined as ETH -> USDC -> DAI, where USDC is the intermediate token.

maxSwap is set to 8000 USDC for the intermediate token (USDC).

The contract attempts to swap 10000 USDC to DAI.

Only 8000 USDC is swapped to DAI, leaving 2000 USDC permanently locked in the contract.



### Impact

users loses rewards 
donation attack is still possible 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

the auditor thinks there is no better solution that to use an offchain oracle for the lending protocol or devise a system that doesnt use a vault system and scrap the maxswap
