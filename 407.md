# `depositFromPairedLpToken()` creates a call to uni v3 pool with the static 1% fee, but on arbitrum the supported pool is currently with 0.3% as per Peapods website

### Summary

`depositFromPairedLpToken()` is used for swapping the paired lp to the rewards token, but the issue is the following.

https://docs.peapods.finance/links/contract-addresses has the currently listed pools on uniswap and as we can see on the Arbitrum one (which will be deployed as per Sherlock's contest page), the pool there is 0.3% and no 1% pool exists.

This will make it such that the function currently can't run on Arbitrum, thus resulting in a broken functionality

### Root Cause

The root cause is that on Arbitrum, no pool with the 1% pool fee tier exists, only with the 0.3% which will result in a revert in its current implementation as we pass the hardcoded 1% fee (as seen in `_swapForRewards()` which is called internally in the function that I mentioned in the title)

### Internal Pre-conditions

The report is valid for Arbitrum exclusively as of now

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Someone calls the `debond()` function, which then calls `_processPreSwapFeesAndSwap() and inside of it `_feeSwap()` which calls `ITokenRewards(_rewards).depositFromPairedLpToken(0);` to swap the paired lp into the rewards token, but this will revert because no uni v3 pool with 1% tier exists on arbitrum, thus the user will be unable to debond

### Impact

Users is unable to debond his pod's token on Arbitrum, thus getting DoSed when trying to swap with a hardcoded 1% on Arbitrum.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

User can't debond and is stucked due to hardcoded 1% and no possibility of it changing to 0.3%
