# some variable have to be update before in the unstake function

### Summary

in the contract **VotingPool** function unstake  should have to first update   **_stake.stakedToOutputDenomenator)**  **_stake.stakedToOutputFactor**; before  calculating **_amtStakeToRemove** in line 51 to get the real time burn amount    
```solidity
  uint256 _amtStakeToRemove = (_amount * _stake.stakedToOutputDenomenator) / _stake.stakedToOutputFactor;
        _stake.amtStaked -= _amtStakeToRemove;
