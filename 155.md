# Non compliant with ERC4626 standard.

### Summary

The functions `previewDeposit()` and `previewMint()` do not comply with the ERC4626 standard, which is inconsistent with the [erc4626 documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#:~:text=MUST%20return%20as%20close%20to%20and%20no%20more%20than%20the%20exact%20amount%20of%20Vault%20shares%20that%20would%20be%20minted%20in%20a%20deposit%20call%20in%20the%20same%20transaction.%20I.e.%20deposit%20should%20return%20the%20same%20or%20more%20shares%20as%20previewDeposit%20if%20called%20in%20the%20same%20transaction.).

### Root Cause

In [AutoCompoundingPodLp:L144-L146](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L144-L146) and [AutoCompoundingPodLp:L120-L122](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L120-L122) the calculate lack of function `_processRewardsToPodLp()`

### Internal Pre-conditions

In the AutoCompoundingPodLp contract, this situation occurs when some funds have not yet been accounted for as rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

The `_processRewardsToPodLp` function converts protocol funds into rewards for users, causing `previewDeposit` and `previewMint` to deviate from expected calculations. In `previewDeposit`, the same amount of assets results in fewer shares minted than expected, contradicting ERC-4626. In `previewMint`, the calculated value exceeds expectations, also diverging from the ERC-4626 standard.
### Impact

Non compliant with ERC4626 standard.

### PoC
run command `forge test --match-test "testERC4626 -vvv"` in AutoCompoundingPodLp.t.sol
```solidity
    function testERC4626() public {
        // Mock the necessary functions and set up the test scenario
        address[] memory rewardTokens = new address[](2);
        rewardTokens[0] = address(rewardToken1);
        rewardTokens[1] = address(rewardToken2);

        mockTokenRewards.setProcessedRewardTokens(rewardTokens);

        uint256 lpAmountOut = 50 * 1e18;
        mockDexAdapter.setSwapV3SingleReturn(lpAmountOut);
        deal(autoCompoundingPodLp.pod().PAIRED_LP_TOKEN(), address(autoCompoundingPodLp), lpAmountOut);
        mockIndexUtils.setAddLPAndStakeReturn(lpAmountOut);

        // Set initial totalAssets
        uint256 initialTotalAssets = 1000 * 1e18;
        deal(address(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()), address(this), initialTotalAssets);
        IERC20(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()).approve(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), initialTotalAssets);
        autoCompoundingPodLp.deposit(initialTotalAssets, address(this));

        uint256 rewardAmount = 100 * 1e18;
        rewardToken1.mint(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), rewardAmount);
        rewardToken2.mint(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), rewardAmount);

        uint256 share = autoCompoundingPodLp.previewDeposit(1000 * 1e18);
        console.log("preview deposit of share: %d", share);
        deal(address(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()), address(this), 10000 * 1e18);
        IERC20(autoCompoundingPodLp.asset()).approve(address(autoCompoundingPodLp), 10000 * 1e18);
        uint256 depositOfShare = autoCompoundingPodLp.deposit(1000 * 1e18, address(autoCompoundingPodLp));
        console.log("deposit of share: %d", depositOfShare);
        // should be depositOfShare more than share
    }
```
### Mitigation

In functions previewMint and previewRedeem consider _processRewardsToPodLp influence
