# `getConversionFactor` will overflow and DOS the voting module

### Summary

`getConversionFactor` will overflow due to faulty math causing a multiplication to exceed uin256.max most of the time.

### Root Cause

By following the math in the comments, it would lead us to the following calculations

`_pricePeasNumX96` -> 3.2e46 as we get the price from `0xae750560b09ad1f5246f3b279b3767afd1d79160`, which is [PEAS : DAI v3 pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae750560b09ad1f5246f3b279b3767afd1d79160#readContract), and with a factor of 1e18 (1 : 1) it would result in a value with 46 decimals. Later this value would be multiplied by k, which is `reserve0 * reserve1`, a value which would be in the magnitude of 1e36 - 1e46 as w tokens with 18 decimals make at lest 1e36.

When these 2 values are multiplied in the final equation we would get a new value with at least 82 decimals, which is way higher than the uint256.max - 1e77.

```solidity
        uint160 _sqrtPriceX96 = TWAP_UTILS.sqrtPriceX96FromPoolAndInterval(PEAS_STABLE_CL_POOL);
        uint256 _priceX96 = TWAP_UTILS.priceX96FromSqrtPriceX96(_sqrtPriceX96);

        uint256 _pricePeasNumX96 = _token1 == PEAS 
            ? _priceX96 

            // 2^96 * 2^96 / 192500005625 = 3.2e46 (PEAS : DAI) -> 0xae750560b09ad1f5246f3b279b3767afd1d79160
            : FixedPoint96.Q96 ** 2 / _priceX96;

        // 3.2e46 * 1e18 / 1e18 = 3.2e46
        // _pricePeasNumX96 * _pFactor / 1e18
        uint256 _pricePPeasNumX96 = (_pricePeasNumX96 * _pFactor) / _pDenomenator;

        (uint112 _reserve0, uint112 _reserve1) = V2_RESERVES.getReserves(_lpTkn);

        uint256 _k = uint256(_reserve0) * _reserve1;

        //@finding H this would be too big for low value tokens
        // 3.2e46 * 1e36 -> 6.4e77
        uint256 _avgTotalPeasInLpX96 = _sqrt(_pricePPeasNumX96 * _k) * 2 ** (96 / 2);

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

No attack path is needed, the function would just not work.

### Impact

`getConversionFactor` would revert almost every time, DOS the whole voting module, as it's used in `_updateUserState`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using a more fractured method for calculating the price, i.e. spread the divisions along the way.
