# `PodUnwrapLocker::_withdraw` would brick all user funds if he gets blacklisted for only 1 of the tokens

### Summary

If a user gets blackliste for one of the tokens this `for` would revert resulting in his funds being stuck.

```solidity
    function _withdraw(address _user, uint256 _lockId) internal {
        LockInfo storage _lock = locks[_lockId];
        require(_lock.user == _user, "W1");
        require(!_lock.withdrawn, "W2");
        require(block.timestamp >= _lock.unlockTime, "W3");

        _lock.withdrawn = true;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _lock.tokens.length; i++) {
            if (_lock.amounts[i] > 0) {
                //@audit if a user gets balcklisted for one of the tokens this reverts
                IERC20(_lock.tokens[i]).safeTransfer(_user, _lock.amounts[i]);
            }
        }

        emit TokensWithdrawn(_lockId, _user, _lock.tokens, _lock.amounts);
    }
```



### Root Cause

Using a loop to distribute different tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Bond is 10% USDT, 10% USDC 40% WETH 40% WBTC
2. User gets blacklisted for USDT
3. His bond is worth 100k
4. All of these assets would remain stuck inside the contract

### Impact

All of our user assets would get stuck inside the contract if he gets blacklisted for 1 of the tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

User pull instead of push. Make sure the user claims his tokens 1 by 1.
