# A vault can be considered not over-utilized when it is and vice versa upon depositing

### Summary

A vault can be considered not over-utilized when it is and vice versa upon depositing

### Root Cause

The root cause is only updating values for a particular vault when we are working with global values, this causes incorrect results.

Upon depositing in `FraxlendPair`, we have a mechanic to off-board some assets to the underlying vault if it is over-utilized:
```solidity
 if (_vaultOverUtilized || _pairOverAllocation) {
        ...
       _withdrawToVault(_extAmount);
       ...
}
```
The issue is that the `_vaultOverUtilized` boolean used above can be incorrect, this is how it is computed:
```solidity
(1e18 * externalAssetVault.totalAssetsUtilized()) / externalAssetVault.totalAssets() > (1e18 * 8) / 10;
```
The `totalAssetsUtilized()` and `totalAssets()` function calls can be out-of-sync as before that, we have this code:
```solidity
externalAssetVault.whitelistUpdate(true);
```
This piece of code updates the asset metadata of a vault/pair. However, it only updates the metadata of the pair we are interacting from and not for the others due to the `whitelistUpdate()` implementation. This will result in out-of-sync values for `totalAssetsUtilized()` and `totalAssets()` as they are global values for all vaults/pairs.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. There are 2 vaults (`VaultA` and `VaultB`), each with an utilization of 100 tokens, both have a pending 10% CBR increase and both have the same `LendingAssetVault` as the external asset vault
2. The current `totalAssetsUtilized` are 200 (`100 + 100 = 200`) and the `totalAssets` are 200, both values in the `LendingAssetVault`
3. Upon a deposit in `FraxlendPair` which corresponds to `VaultA`, we update the utilization of `vaultA` to 110 (10% CBR increase as mentioned), the `totalAssetsUtilized` to 210 (10 token increase coming from the utilization increase) and `totalAssets` to 264 (again 10 token increase)
4. The utilization ratio is `210 / 264 = 0,7954545455` which is below the required 0.8 or 80%
5. The issue is that the utilization ratio is actually above 80% as if we factored in the other vault's pending update, we would have had `totalAssetsUtilized` equal to 220 and `totalAssets` equal to 274 which is `220 / 274 = 0,802919708`, over 80% which is the threshold

### Impact

A vault can be considered non over-utilized when it is which will result in a break of core contract functionality. The opposite can also happen if there is a pending CBR decrease.

### Mitigation

Update the metadata for all vaults instead
