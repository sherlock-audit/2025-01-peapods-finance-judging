# L0ckin7 - Incorrect Handling of `_protocolFees` in `_tokenToPodLp`

### Summary

The `_protocolFees` are deducted from the `_pairedOut` amount, but the `_protocolFees` are not reset or properly accounted for in subsequent transactions.

### Impact

This could lead to incorrect fee calculations, if `_pairedOut` is less than `_amountIn` (due to slippage), the fee calculation could result in a larger fee than intended, reducing the amount available for LP conversion.
This could lead to a loss of funds for users or the protocol.

### Recommendations

The issue can be fixed by calculating the protocol fee based on the input amount (`_amountIn`) rather than the output amount (`_pairedOut`). Additionally, the fee should be deducted from the input amount before processing the swap.

```solidity
function _tokenToPodLp(address _token, uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountLpOutMin, uint256 _deadline)
    internal
    returns (uint256 _lpAmtOut)
{
    // Calculate protocol fee based on input amount
    uint256 _protocolFeeAmount = (_amountIn * protocolFee) / 1000;
    if (_protocolFeeAmount > 0) {
        _protocolFees += _protocolFeeAmount; // Add fee to protocol fees
        _amountIn -= _protocolFeeAmount; // Deduct fee from input amount
    }

    // Process the remaining input amount
    uint256 _pairedOut = _tokenToPairedLpToken(_token, _amountIn);
    if (_pairedOut > 0) {
        _lpAmtOut = _pairedLpTokenToPodLp(_pairedOut, _deadline);
        require(_lpAmtOut >= _amountLpOutMin, "M");
    }
}
```
This ensures that the fee is consistent and proportional to the user's input.
