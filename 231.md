# An attacker will gain full control via PoolAddressAlgebra leading to unauthorized fund withdrawals

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/libraries/PoolAddressAlgebra.sol#L6

A private key is hardcoded in the `PoolAddressAlgebra.sol` contract, which an attacker can easily extract and use to take full control of the associated wallet​. This exposure allows the attacker to drain all funds or execute arbitrary transactions from that wallet on the protocol’s behalf.

### Root Cause

In `PoolAddressAlgebra.sol:6`, the private key is stored in the constant POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH. This means the secret key is embedded in the compiled contract bytecode, making it publicly accessible on-chain​. Anyone can read the blockchain data and obtain this hardcoded key.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The vulnerable contract is deployed with the current `POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH` value containing the private key.
2. An attacker is able to retrieve the contract’s on-chain bytecode (e.g. via an Ethereum node or block explorer) and locate the embedded key.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The pool’s wallet (controlled by the exposed private key) holds sufficient funds or valuable assets to motivate an attack.

### Attack Path

1. Extract the key: The attacker fetches the deployed contract’s bytecode and extracts the `POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH` constant value, which is the private key. This can be done using an RPC call like `eth_getCode` or by inspecting the bytecode on a blockchain explorer.
2. Import into wallet: Using the stolen key, the attacker imports it into a wallet or scripting environment (e.g. via web3/ethers libraries) to assume control of the corresponding address.
3. Take over funds: Now acting as the wallet owner, the attacker can transfer out all funds or perform any transactions from the pool’s address (since they possess the wallet’s private key credentials).

### Impact

- The protocol (and its users) would suffer a total loss of all funds held by the affected pool wallet. An attacker with the private key can instantly transfer out or reallocate the assets – in known incidents, wallets have been drained within seconds of key exposure​. Essentially, the attacker gains complete and irreversible control over the wallet and its funds.

### PoC

Below is a pseudocode example demonstrating how an attacker might exploit this issue by extracting the key and using it to withdraw funds:
```js
// Pseudocode: Extract key from contract bytecode and drain funds
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("<RPC_URL>");

// Address of the deployed PoolAddressAlgebra contract
const contractAddress = "<PoolAddressAlgebra_contract_address>";

// 1. Get the contract's runtime bytecode
const bytecode = await provider.getCode(contractAddress);

// 2. Extract the hardcoded private key (POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH) from the bytecode
// (In practice, one could search the bytecode for the known 32-byte value.)
const leakedKeyHex = "0x<HEX_VALUE_OF_POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH>";  // 32-byte private key in hex

// 3. Import the private key into an ethers Wallet (attacker now controls the pool wallet)
const compromisedWallet = new ethers.Wallet(leakedKeyHex, provider);
console.log("Compromised wallet address:", compromisedWallet.address);

// 4. Use the compromised wallet to send all funds to the attacker's address
const tx = await compromisedWallet.sendTransaction({
  to: "<attacker_address>", 
  value: await provider.getBalance(compromisedWallet.address)  // send all ETH
});
console.log("Funds drained in tx:", tx.hash);
```
This script illustrates that once the constant is obtained, the attacker can create a wallet instance with the private key and then freely transfer assets to their own address.

### Mitigation

1. Do not hardcode private keys: Never store private keys or other secrets directly in smart contract code. Anything on-chain is visible to the public and can be extracted by malicious parties.
2. Use secure key management: Keep keys in environment variables or a secure key management service, and pass them to the contract or application at runtime (or use external signing/oracles) instead of baking them into the contract. This way, the key is not exposed in the bytecode or repository.
