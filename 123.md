# Removing leverage will often revert due to calling an incorrect function

### Summary

Removing leverage will often revert due to calling an incorrect function

### Root Cause

Upon removing leverage, we have the following 2 functions being called:
```solidity
IFraxlendPair(_lendingPair).addInterest(false);
bytes memory _additionalInfo = abi.encode(IFraxlendPair(_lendingPair).totalBorrow().toShares(_borrowAssetAmt, false), ..............)
```
There are 2 issues which cause the issue. Firstly, `addInterest()` has the following case:
```solidity
if (_currentUtilizationRate != 0 && _rateChange < (_currentUtilizationRate * minURChangeForExternalAddInterest) / UTIL_PREC) {
            emit SkipAddingInterest(_rateChange);
        } else {
            ...
        }
```
There is an optimization scenario which skips the interest accrual when there hasn't been a utilization ratio change of at least `minURChangeForExternalAddInterest`. Then, the other function called simply returns this calculation:
```solidity
shares = (amount * total.shares) / total.amount;
            if (roundUp && (shares * total.amount) / total.shares < amount) {
                shares = shares + 1;
            }
```
These 2 things combined cause an issue. The first function can skip the interest accrual and the second function does not preview the interest accrual as it uses cached values. This means that the `_borrowAssetAmt` used for the share conversion will result in a wrong amount of shares as the interest is not factored in (when `addInterest()` skips interest). Then, upon the repayment, we use the following code:
```solidity
IFraxlendPair(_posProps.lendingPair).repayAsset(_borrowSharesToRepay, _posProps.custodian);
```
The function is called with the shares which supposedly convert to the provided borrow amount. However, this is not the case due to the reason mentioned above, the shares will equal a higher borrow amount due to the interest accrual which __never__ gets skipped upon `repayAsset()` (the internal `_addInterest()` call always adds interest if there's any unlike the `addInterest()`):
```solidity
function repayAsset(uint256 _shares, address _borrower) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 _amountToRepay) {
        ...

        // Accrue interest if necessary
        _addInterest();

        ...
    }
```
This will result in a revert as we only approved the provided borrow amount which is less than the one with accrued interest:
```solidity
IERC20(_borrowTkn).safeIncreaseAllowance(_lendingPair, _borrowAssetAmt);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The UR change is not enough so interest is skipped when calling `addInterest()`

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

No attack path necessary, the `Root Cause` section explains it in great detail

### Impact

Removing leverage will cause a revert in a lot of cases, basically in every case where there is interest to accrue and the UR change is not big enough which is __very__ often.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `toAssetShares()` instead with a preview interest boolean of true. In that case, the `addInterest()` is unnecessary (if not mistaken).
