# Incorrect `min/maxPrice` checks

### Summary

Incorrect `min/maxPrice` checks

### Root Cause

`ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle::_isValidAnswer()` implements the following check:
```solidity
if (_answer > _max || _answer < _min) {
        _isValid = false;
}
```
The issue is that the check is incorrect as it does not include the `=` sign. Also note that the min and max prices are deprecated but still available on some feeds such as DAI/USD on Arbitrum (DAI is supposed to be used as PAIRED_LP_TOKEN): https://arbiscan.io/address/0xFc06bB03a9e1D8033f87eA6A682cbd65477A43b9#readContract.
