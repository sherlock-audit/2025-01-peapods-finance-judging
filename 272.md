# Incorrect Skipping of the `addInterest` Function


### Summary
The `FraxlendPair::addInterest` function could be skipped even if there are significant unaccounted interests.

### Root Cause
In the `addInterest` function, the function can be skipped even when there are significant unaccounted interests. 
This occurs because interest is accounted for based on changes in utilization, and unaccounted interest does not affect utilization.

```solidity
    function addInterest(bool _returnAccounting)
        ...
306:    uint256 _currentUtilizationRate = _prevUtilizationRate;
        uint256 _totalAssetsAvailable = totalAsset.totalAmount(address(externalAssetVault));
        uint256 _newUtilizationRate =
            _totalAssetsAvailable == 0 ? 0 : (UTIL_PREC * totalBorrow.amount) / _totalAssetsAvailable;
        uint256 _rateChange = _newUtilizationRate > _currentUtilizationRate
            ? _newUtilizationRate - _currentUtilizationRate
            : _currentUtilizationRate - _newUtilizationRate;
        if (
            _currentUtilizationRate != 0
                && _rateChange < _currentUtilizationRate * minURChangeForExternalAddInterest / UTIL_PREC
        ) {
317:        emit SkipAddingInterest(_rateChange);
        } else {
            (, _interestEarned, _feesAmount, _feesShare, _currentRateInfo) = _addInterest();
320:    }
```
If `_rateChange < _currentUtilizationRate * minURChangeForExternalAddInterest / UTIL_PREC`, the function is skipped.

### PoC
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/libraries/VaultAccount.sol#L16
```solidity
16: function totalAmount(VaultAccount memory total, address vault) internal view returns (uint256 amount) {
        if (vault == address(0)) {
            return total.amount;
        }
        return total.amount + IERC4626Extended(vault).totalAvailableAssetsForVault(address(this));
    }
```
Let `prevUtilizationRate = currentUtilizationRate` and `unaccounted interest = 0`.
Over time, interest increases.
However, regardless of how much interest increases, both `totalAmount` and `currentUtilizationRate` remain unchanged.
As a result, the `addInterest` function is skipped.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L303
The `addInterest` function is used to calculate the `totalAmount` of `LendingAssetVault`. 
Therefore, the `totalAmount` of `LendingAssetVault` may not be correct, potentially leading to profit or loss of funds for the providers of `LendingAssetVault` during deposits or redemptions.

A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to seize the profits of the `LendingAssetVault`. 
Consider this scenario:
`totalAsset.shares = 50e18`, `unaccounted interest = 5e18`, `LendingAssetVault's share = 30e18`.
`unaccounted external vault's interest = 3e18`.
external vault's total shares = 40e18.
1. Alice mint 10e18 shares from LendingAssetVault:
    At this time, FraxlendPair::interest is skipped.
2. Alice Deposits into FraxlendPair:
    Amount deposited: 1 wei.
    At this time, `FraxlendPair::interest` is updated.
3. Alice Withdraws 10e18 shares from `LendingAssetVault`:
At this time, Alice takes 0.6e18.

### Impact
Loss of funds for the providers of `LendingAssetVault`.
A malicious user can extract the profit of `LendingAssetVault`.

### Mitigation
Consider the implementation related to the update time of interest.
