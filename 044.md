# Incorrect total assets available calculation leads to incorrect utilisation

### Summary

Incorrect total assets available calculation leads to incorrect utilisation ratio

### Root Cause

Upon adding interest in `FraxlendPairCore`, we have the following code:
```solidity
uint256 _totalAssetsAvailable = _totalAssetAvailable(totalAsset, totalBorrow, true);
_prevUtilizationRate = _totalAssetsAvailable == 0 ? 0 : (UTIL_PREC * totalBorrow.amount) / _totalAssetsAvailable;
```
`_totalAssetsAvailable` is calculated using the following code:
```solidity
return _totalAsset.totalAmount(address(externalAssetVault)) - _totalBorrow.amount;
```
This causes the calculation to be incorrect as `_totalAssetsAvailable` is already subtracted by the `totalBorrow.amount` used in the utilisation ratio calculation.

Another issue stemming from that is the fact that if the `_totalAssetsAvailable` are 0, thus all are borrowed (as we are subtracting the borrowed assets), we have a utilisation ratio of 0 which is completely incorrect, it should be 100%.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

First scenario:
1. The utilisation ratio goes from 0 to 100% in one borrow (completely possible and likely especially during early times of the vault)
2. Upon interest being added next time, the previous utilisation ratio is set to 0 incorrectly (should be 100%)
3. Then upon adding interest, we won't pass the threshold as we supposedly went from 0 to 0, interest won't accrue even though we have a utilisation ratio change of 100%

Second scenario:
1. The total borrow amount is 60 and the total amount is 100
2. The total available assets are thus 40, the calculation would be `1e18 * 60 / 40 = 1.5e18` which is 150%, completely incorrect

### Impact

The utilization ratio is incorrect and is used in multiple checks, the results will be completely incorrect

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `totalAsset.totalAmount(address(externalAssetVault))` instead
