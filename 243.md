# Fraxlend borrowers can pay less borrow fees

### Summary

When interests are accrued, the interest rate is determined by the utilization rate of the pair, which is determined by the total borrow amount and the total asset amount. However, the `FraxlendPairCore` mistakenly calculates the assets sitting in the LAV as part of the total assets, leading to lower utilization rate and lower interest rate.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is in [`_addInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L456) and [`_calculateInterest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L398) where it includes the available assets in the LAV as part of the total assets.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

- A user had borrowed assets from a FraxlendPair

### Attack Path

- Current utilization rate of a FraxlendPair is 90%, 9000 DAI is borrowed, and 1000 DAI is deposited in total, including the available assets in the LAV
- Alice flashloans 1000 DAI and deposit into the LAV, which makes the utilization rate 45%
- Alice calls `repayAsset` to repay her debts, paying less borrow fees
- Alice withdraws her 1000 DAI from LAV

### Impact

Users can pay less borrow fees than they should

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The available assets in the LAV should not be included in the total assets of the FraxlendPair when calculating the utilization rate.
