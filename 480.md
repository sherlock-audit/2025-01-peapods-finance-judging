# Oracle circuit breaker check (minAnswer, maxAnswer) is incorrect.


### Summary

Oracle circuit breaker check (minAnswer, maxAnswer) is incorrect.

### Root Cause

`ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle` implemented a check for circuit breaker, the minAnswer, maxAnswer check. However, this check is wrong.

A simple introduction to the circuit breaker mechanism in Chainlink: For some data feed aggregators, there is a `minAnswer/maxAnswer` check, that if the oracle price feed falls out of range, it will simply return the `minAnswer/maxAnswer`. For example, if the price falls below `minAnswer`, the oracle will simply return `minAnswer`. See https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits for more details.

The current check is `if (_answer > _max || _answer < _min)`. However, according to how circuit breakers work, this would never happen, because if the price falls out of the range, it would simply return `_max` and `_min`. The correct check should be `if (_answer >= _max || _answer <= _min)`.

Some examples that still have minAnswer/maxAnswer is the [AAVE/USD](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3c6AbdA21358c15601A3175D8dd66D0c572cc904#readContract) pair on Arbitrum. The minAnswer is 100000000, maxAnswer is 10000000000000 with a decimal of 8. If AAVE is the underlyingTKN of a pod, with USDC as pairedLpTKN, and supports LVF feature, this oracle would be used.

Note that in history, the circuit breaker caused this issue https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/ during the LUNA crash.

```solidity
    function _isValidAnswer(address _feed, int256 _answer) internal view returns (bool _isValid) {
        _isValid = true;
        int192 _min = IOffchainAggregator(IEACAggregatorProxy(_feed).aggregator()).minAnswer();
        int192 _max = IOffchainAggregator(IEACAggregatorProxy(_feed).aggregator()).maxAnswer();

        if (_answer > _max || _answer < _min) {
            _isValid = false;
        }
    }
```

### Impact

Oracle would return incorrect price if price falls out of range, which affects lending market.
