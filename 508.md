# Either Voting or staking pool tokens minting can be blocked

### Summary

When tokens are minted in the `StakingPoolToken` and `VotingPool` contracts there is a call to `setShares()` in the `TokenRewards` contract of the respective rewards tokens

```solidity
File: VotingPool.sol
114:     function _update(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) internal override {
115:         super._update(_from, _to, _value);
116:         require(_from == address(0) || _to == address(0), "NT");
117:@>       if (_from != address(0)) {
118:             TokenRewards(REWARDS).setShares(_from, _value, true);
119:         }
120:         if (_to != address(0) && _to != address(0xdead)) {
121:@>           TokenRewards(REWARDS).setShares(_to, _value, false);
122:         }
123:     }

```

### Root Cause

There is a check in the `TokenRewards::setShares()` function to ensure that only the set `trackingToken` can call the function. 


```solidity
File: TokenRewards.sol
097:     function setShares(address _wallet, uint256 _amount, bool _sharesRemoving) external override {
098:@>       require(_msgSender() == trackingToken, "UNAUTHORIZED");
099:         _setShares(_wallet, _amount, _sharesRemoving);
100:     }

```

The problem is that the `trackingToken` can be set only once in the `TokenRewards` contract

```solidity
File: TokenRewards.sol
60: 
61:     function initialize(address _indexFund, address _trackingToken, bool _leaveAsPaired, bytes memory _immutables)
62:         public
63:         initializer
64:     {

/////SNIP
83:         LEAVE_AS_PAIRED_LP_TOKEN = _leaveAsPaired;
84:         trackingToken = _trackingToken; // SPT token or Voting Token

```

Hence in a situation where the Voting or staking pool reward tokens are the same, `trackingToken` will be set to either `StakingPoolToken` or `VotingPool`. Thus it will revert when the call is made from the contract that has not been set as the `trackingToken`. 


NOTE: the sponsor confirmed that the Voting or staking pool  may or may not be the same in a private thread and I believe the Lead Judge can affirm this from the team.

### Internal Pre-conditions

the Voting or staking pool reward tokens are the same

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

- the Voting or staking pool reward tokens are the same
- `trackingToken` can be either stakin pool token or voting pool not both.
Hence when `_update` is called during minting it wil revert as described int he root cause section

### Impact

This leads to a denial of service as users will not be able to stake in either the staking pool or the voting pool since minting will be blocked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There is no trivial solution to this except the protocol will strictly ensure that both staking pool token and voting pool token do not use the same reward tokens
