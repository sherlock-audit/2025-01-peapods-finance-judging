# Front-Running in Swap functions

#### Issue Description
The swap functions lack commit-reveal schemes, making them vulnerable to front-running by miners or bots. This can result in users receiving less favorable prices than expected.

#### Impact
While the protocol includes `amountOutMin` parameters to mitigate front-running, users may still experience losses if they fail to set appropriate values. The absence of a robust mechanism to prevent front-running increases the risk of exploitation.

#### Proof of Concept
1. A user submits a swap transaction with a low gas fee.
2. A miner observes the transaction in the mempool and executes a similar trade with a higher gas fee.
3. The miner's transaction is processed first, altering the pool price.
4. The user's transaction executes at a worse price, resulting in financial loss.

#### Recommendation
Implement slippage tolerance checks and educate users to set appropriate `amountOutMin` values. Consider integrating commit-reveal schemes to further mitigate front-running risks.

```solidity
// Enforce slippage tolerance
if (_amountOutMin == 0) {
    _amountOutMin = (expectedAmountOut * 995) / 1000;
}
```
