# Transaction may revert unexpectedly due to missing allowance for the lending pair asset

### Summary

Transaction may revert unexpectedly due to missing allowance for the lending pair asset

### Root Cause

In [Leverage Manager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L166C1-L182C88), remove leverage function firstly updates the interest rate of the lending for proper calculation of repay asset. 

```solidity
&>      IFraxlendPair(_lendingPair).addInterest(false);

        // if additional fees required for flash source, handle that here
        _processExtraFlashLoanPayment(_positionId, _sender);

        address _borrowTkn = _getBorrowTknForPod(_positionId);

        // needed to repay flash loaned asset in lending pair
        // before removing collateral and unwinding
&>      IERC20(_borrowTkn).safeIncreaseAllowance(_lendingPair, _borrowAssetAmt);

        LeverageFlashProps memory _props;
        _props.method = FlashCallbackMethod.REMOVE;
        _props.positionId = _positionId;
        _props.owner = _owner;
        bytes memory _additionalInfo = abi.encode(
&>          IFraxlendPair(_lendingPair).totalBorrow().toShares(_borrowAssetAmt, false),
```

The problem is `addInterest` function doesn't guarantee interest update because it only updates the interest if utilization rate change threshold is exceed. But in `repayAsset` function it guarantees interest accrual and the calculations for the share amount will be different than actual.

```solidity
        LeveragePositionProps memory _posProps = positionProps[_props.positionId];

        // allowance increases for _borrowAssetAmt prior to flash loaning asset
&>      IFraxlendPair(_posProps.lendingPair).repayAsset(_borrowSharesToRepay, _posProps.custodian);
```

The `repayAsset` call will revert due to missing allowance because after interest accrual `_borrowSharesToRepay` value will require more assets than calculated.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Utilization rate change shouldn't exceed the threshold while repayment process

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

1. User is close to liquidation threshold and he wants to reduce leverage for safety
2. He calls remove leverage function but it reverts due to issue
3. User is liquidated because of price fluctation

### Impact

Remove leverage is time-sensitive function because it saves the position from liquidation point and it increases the health of the position. This is why it has to work as expected. In given scenario, user can be liquidated due to unexpected revert in repayment process.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead calculate the share amount using preview interest method
