# No decimal normalisation upon calling `TokenRewards::depositFromPairedLpToken()`

### Summary

No decimal normalisation upon calling `TokenRewards::depositFromPairedLpToken()`

### Root Cause

Upon calling `TokenRewards::depositFromPairedLpToken()`, we have the following code:
```solidity
uint256 _amountOut = _token0 == PAIRED_LP_TOKEN ? (_rewardsPriceX96 * _amountTkn) / FixedPoint96.Q96 : (_amountTkn * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _rewardsPriceX96;
```
The `priceX96` is inverted if needed. However, there is no decimal normalisation done at any point during the function execution. Thus, if the paired LP token and the reward token are in different decimals, the result will be completely incorrect.

NOTE: The reward token and the paired LP token being in different decimals is completely expected. The developer has mentioned in a public channel that USDC will be used which has 6 decimals.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `TokenRewards::depositFromPairedLpToken()` is called and the paired LP token, USDC, has to be converted to an 18-decimal reward token
2. The amount out will be in 6 decimals which will result in a __HUGE__ slippage allowed, practically the slippage protection will be non-existent
3. The other scenario would be if the reward token has less decimals than the paired LP token, which will simply cause a revert

### Impact

Theft of funds or reverts

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Convert the decimals accordingly
