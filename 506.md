# Inability to reassign `stakeUserRestriction` after removal in `StakingPoolToken` contract

### Summary

In `StakingPoolToken` contract, the inability to reassign `stakeUserRestriction` after removal will cause a permanent loss of control over user staking permissions. Since `stakeUserRestriction` is used to enforce access control in the `stake()` function, its removal prevents any future modifications to staking restrictions.


### Root Cause

The `stakeUserRestriction` variable determines whether a specific address is allowed to stake on behalf of others. It is enforced in the `stake()` function as follows:

```solidity
    function stake(address _user, uint256 _amount) external override {
        require(stakingToken != address(0), "I");
@>      if (stakeUserRestriction != address(0)) {
@>          require(_user == stakeUserRestriction, "U");
        }
        _mint(_user, _amount);
        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
        emit Stake(_msgSender(), _user, _amount);
    }
```

- If `stakeUserRestriction` is set, only the specified address can stake tokens for a user.
- If `stakeUserRestriction` is `address(0)`, anyone can stake, which may not be desirable in some cases.

However, the contract allows `stakeUserRestriction` to be permanently removed via the `removeStakeUserRestriction()` function:

```solidity
    function removeStakeUserRestriction() external onlyRestricted {
        stakeUserRestriction = address(0);
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/StakingPoolToken.sol#L93C4-L95C6

- This function can only be called by the current stakeUserRestriction due to the onlyRestricted modifier

```solidity
    modifier onlyRestricted() {
        require(_msgSender() == stakeUserRestriction, "R");
        _;
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/StakingPoolToken.sol#L33C4-L36C6

### Internal Pre-conditions

Once `stakeUserRestriction` is removed

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Once `stakeUserRestriction` is removed (`address(0)`), the `onlyRestricted` modifier ensures that no one can call `setStakeUserRestriction()` again to reassign it:

```solidity
function setStakeUserRestriction(address _user) external onlyRestricted {
    stakeUserRestriction = _user;
}
```
This makes the removal irreversible, leading to permanent loss of access control in stake().

### Impact

-	**Irreversible change:** The inability to reassign `stakeUserRestriction` means governance cannot recover restricted staking

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow the owner to reset the restriction

```diff
-   function setStakeUserRestriction(address _user) external onlyRestricted {
+   function setStakeUserRestriction(address _user) external {
+    require(msg.sender == owner() || msg.sender == stakeUserRestriction, "Unauthorized");
        stakeUserRestriction = _user;
    }
```
