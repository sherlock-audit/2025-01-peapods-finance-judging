# some funds will not be converted nor returned to the depositor

### Summary

in the contract **TokenRewards**  function **depositFromPairedLpToken**   line 177 it will try to swap the  **PAIRED_LP_TOKEN** into **reward**  and it uses the function **_swapForRewards** and if **_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride** is greater than zero it will override the **amounin** variable and use that instead of the one that the user deposited so if   **_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride** is less than the one that the user deposited it will try to swap a small amount the problem here is that the user will not receive the remaining amount which is (the amount that the user deposited - _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride)

```solidity
if (_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0) {
            _adminAmt = (_adminAmt * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountOut = (_amountOut * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride;
        }
```
