# L0ckin7 - Reentrancy Risk in `_withdraw` and `_deposit` Functions

### Summary

The `_withdraw` and `_deposit` functions transfer tokens before updating the internal state (`_totalAssets`), this can lead to reentrancy attacks.

AutoCompoundingPodLp : 

`_deposit`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L135

```solidity
IERC20(_asset()).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _assets);
```
This transfers tokens from the caller before updating `_totalAssets`.

`_withdraw`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L199

```solidity
IERC20(_asset()).safeTransfer(_receiver, _assets);
```
This transfers tokens before reducing _totalAssets and burning shares.

### Impact

Allow an attacker to manipulate the contract's state, such as withdrawing more tokens than they are entitled to.

### Attack Path

If an attacker deposits a small amount to the contract then calls withdraw triggering `_withdraw`, a malicious fallback function in the attacker's contract can re-enters `_withdraw` before `_totalAssets` and balances are updated, the attacker calls withdraw again draining funds before state updates.

 ### Recommendations

We can use OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard`:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract AutoCompoundingPodLp is IERC4626, ERC20, ERC20Permit, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
```
Then, add nonReentrant to `_withdraw` and `_deposit`:

```solidity
function _deposit(uint256 _assets, uint256 _shares, address _receiver) internal nonReentrant {
```

```solidity
function _withdraw(uint256 _assets, uint256 _shares, address _caller, address _owner, address _receiver) internal nonReentrant {
```

So we ensures state updates are completed before external calls, preventing reentrancy attacks.
