# Two hop swaps can be used drain any token from the indexUtils contract

### Summary

the swapV2 function double hop swaps where the in token is first swapped to another token before being swapped to the out token  
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/Zapper.sol#L213
```solidity
        if (_twoHops) {
            uint256 _intermediateBal = IERC20(_path[1]).balanceOf(address(this));
            IERC20(_path[1]).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _intermediateBal);
            DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_path[1], _path[2], _intermediateBal, _amountOutMin, address(this));
        }
```
the issue here is that after the first swap, the entire balance of the intermediary token is used for the second swap, including tokens that were already in the contract, allowing the sender to drain the contract of the intermediary token 
note: all tokens accumulated in the indexUtils are meant to be withdrawn by the owner

```solidity
    function rescueERC20(IERC20 _token) external onlyOwner {
        require(_token.balanceOf(address(this)) > 0);
        _token.safeTransfer(owner(), _token.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```
 and several checks are made across several functions to ensure that users do not withdraw or use more tokens that then sent

### Root Cause

The entire contract balance of the intermediary token is used for the swap 

### Internal Pre-conditions

path must exist in which the token the attacker wants to drain is the intermediary token 



### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The user calls addLpAndStake with pairedToken provided such that the path specified such that pairedTokenProvided -> token user wants to drain -> paired token of index fund 
2.swap occurs from token provided to drain token 
3. entire balance (previous balance + balanmce gained from swap) is used to swap to paired token if index fund draining the entire balance 

### Impact

users can make use of tokens meant to be withdrawn by the owner 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

track the previous balance of the intermediary token before the first swap and only use the new balance for swaps
