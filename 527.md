# donation attack

**Description:**  
The protocol does not account for external token donations, which can lead to incorrect balance calculations. Attackers can exploit this by donating tokens to manipulate the protocol's internal state.

**Impact:**  
- Incorrect balance calculations can disrupt core functionalities like swaps and rewards distribution.
- Potential for financial losses due to miscalculations.

**Recommendation:**  
- Implement safeguards to ignore unexpected token balances.
- Use snapshot mechanisms to track balances before and after operations.

**Code Reference:**  
```solidity
uint256 _bal = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (_token == pod.PAIRED_LP_TOKEN() ? _protocolFees : 0);
```
