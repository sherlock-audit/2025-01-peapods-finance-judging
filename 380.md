# `_closeFeeAmt` is bypassed when removing leverage if borrow tokens need to be acquired

### Summary

`_closeFeeAmt` is charged on the `pTKN` amount the user receives when removing leverage. A user will however avoid paying this fee when the `pTKN` to be received is converted to the borrow amount before the fee is calculated.

### Root Cause

In `LeverageManager.callback`, the `_closeFeeAmt` is only charged on the `pTKN` amount sent to the user:

```solidity
        } else if (_posProps.method == FlashCallbackMethod.REMOVE) {
            (uint256 _ptknToUserAmt, uint256 _pairedLpToUser) = _removeLeveragePostCallback(_userData);
            if (_ptknToUserAmt > 0) {
                // if there's a close fee send returned pod tokens for fee to protocol
                if (closeFeePerc > 0) {
                    uint256 _closeFeeAmt = (_ptknToUserAmt * closeFeePerc) / 1000;
                    IERC20(_pod).safeTransfer(feeReceiver, _closeFeeAmt);
                    _ptknToUserAmt -= _closeFeeAmt;
                }
                IERC20(_pod).safeTransfer(_posProps.owner, _ptknToUserAmt);
            }
            if (_pairedLpToUser > 0) {
                IERC20(_getBorrowTknForPod(_posProps.positionId)).safeTransfer(_posProps.owner, _pairedLpToUser);
            }
```

When the flashloan amount to be repaid is higher that the borrow tokens received during the removal of leverage process. the `LeverageManager` initiates a swap of the `pTKN` amount into borrow tokens:

```solidity
        // pay back flash loan and send remaining to borrower
        uint256 _repayAmount = _d.amount + _d.fee;
        if (_pairedAmtReceived < _repayAmount) {
            _podAmtRemaining = _acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment(
                _props,
                _posProps.pod,
                _d.token,
                _repayAmount - _pairedAmtReceived,
                _podAmtReceived,
                _podSwapAmtOutMin,
                _userProvidedDebtAmtMax
            );
        }
        IERC20(_d.token).safeTransfer(IFlashLoanSource(_getFlashSource(_props.positionId)).source(), _repayAmount);
        _borrowAmtRemaining = _pairedAmtReceived > _repayAmount ? _pairedAmtReceived - _repayAmount : 0;
        emit RemoveLeverage(_props.positionId, _props.owner, _collateralAssetRemoveAmt);
    }
```

The end result is that the `_podAmtRemaining` will be decreased so that by the time the `_closeFeeAmt` is being charged, some fees are lost. What this means is that the user successfully removes leverage and does pay the full close fees.

This means the fee receiver loses close fees for removal of leverage.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The amount required to repay the flashloan is less than the borrow tokens available.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User initiates removal of leverage.
2. `pTKN` tokens are swapped for the borrow token before the close fee is charged.
3. Fee receiver loses close fees.

Also note that by specifying a high amount of `_podSwapAmtOutMin`, the user can ensure a higher number of `pTKN` tokens are swapped for the borrow token.

### Impact

The fee receiver loses close fees. 
The fee can be as high as 25% meaning that even a dollar amount of 100 worth of `pTKN` tokens swapped to the borrow token would result in a 25 dollar value loss when removing leverage. 

### PoC

- `pTKN` tokens worth 100USD are swapped into the borrow token.
- Assume a close fee of 250 (25%)
- The fee receiver will lose 25USD worth of fees because they are calculated after the swap.

### Mitigation

Calculate the `_closeFeeAmt` on the `_podAmtRemaining` value before the `_acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment` is called and ensure there are enough tokens to cover both the repayment of the flash loan and the payment of the `_closeFeeAmt`.
