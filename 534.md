# Sandwitch attacks in the contract `AutoCompoundingPodLp`

### Summary

In the contract `AutoCompoundingPodLp`, the functions `deposit`, `mint`, `withdraw` and `redeem` will invoke the function `_processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp)` with the `_amountLpOutMin` to be zero which means there is no slippage protection in the process for rewards to podlp. Thus a malicious user could conduct sandwich attacks to them.

```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);
        _shares = _convertToShares(_assets, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
    }
```

        _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);

```solidity

        _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);
        _shares = _convertToShares(_assets, Math.Rounding.Ceil);

```

```solidity
    function redeem(uint256 _shares, address _receiver, address _owner) external override returns (uint256 _assets) {
        _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);
        _assets = _convertToAssets(_shares, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        _withdraw(_assets, _shares, _msgSender(), _owner, _receiver);
    }
```

### Root Cause

The functions `deposit`, `mint`, `withdraw` and `redeem` will invoke the function `_processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp)` with the `_amountLpOutMin` to be zero which means there is no slippage protection in the process for rewards to podlp.
