# An attacker will bypass access control and manipulate index data, impacting protocol users

### Summary

In [_authorizedOwnerOrCreator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/IndexManager.sol#L113C17-L113C21), the lack of a bounds check on _indexIdx[_index] allows an attacker to reference an uninitialized or non-existent index, which defaults to 0.

### Root Cause

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

An attacker could call functions requiring _authorizedOwnerOrCreator authorization by passing an invalid _index address (such as address(0) or an uninitialized value), tricking the contract into treating them as an authorized entity.

### Impact

The contractâ€™s access control can be bypassed, allowing unauthorized users to modify or manipulate index data, potentially leading to unauthorized fund transfers or contract corruption.
