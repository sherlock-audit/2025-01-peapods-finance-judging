# AutoCompoundingPodLP is not EIP4626 compliant.


### Summary

AutoCompoundingPodLP is not EIP4626 compliant.

### Root Cause

First, the README explicitly states ERC4626 should be complied to:

> Q: Is the codebase expected to comply with any specific EIPs?
> 
> Many of our contracts implement ERC20 and ERC4626 which we attempt to comply with in the entirety of those standards for contracts that implement them.

According to the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626,

1. `previewDeposit()` should always underestimate compared to actual calling `deposit()`. However, currently it overestimates the amount of shares minted, because it does not consider to-be-compounded rewards.

> MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be minted in a deposit call in the same transaction. I.e. deposit should return the same or more shares as previewDeposit if called in the same transaction.

```solidity
    function _convertToShares(uint256 _assets, Math.Rounding _roundDirection) internal view returns (uint256 _shares) {
        return Math.mulDiv(_assets, FACTOR, _cbr(), _roundDirection);
    }
    // @audit-bug: This does not include rewards, so the asset/reward ratio is smaller, leading to larger amount of shares.
    function previewDeposit(uint256 _assets) external view override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        return _convertToShares(_assets, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    }
    function deposit(uint256 _assets, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);
        _shares = _convertToShares(_assets, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
    }
```

2. `previewMint()` should always overestimate compared to actual calling `mint()`. However, currently it underestimates the amount of assets required, because it does not consider to-be-compounded rewards.

> MUST return as close to and no fewer than the exact amount of assets that would be deposited in a mint call in the same transaction. I.e. mint should return the same or fewer assets as previewMint if called in the same transaction.

```solidity
    function _convertToAssets(uint256 _shares, Math.Rounding _roundDirection) internal view returns (uint256 _assets) {
        return Math.mulDiv(_shares, _cbr(), FACTOR, _roundDirection);
    }
    // @audit-bug: This does not include rewards, so the asset/reward ratio is smaller, leading to less amount of assets.
    function previewMint(uint256 _shares) external view override returns (uint256 _assets) {
        _assets = _convertToAssets(_shares, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
    }
    function mint(uint256 _shares, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _assets) {
        _processRewardsToPodLp(0, block.timestamp);
        _assets = _convertToAssets(_shares, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
        _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
    }
```

3. Event of `_withdraw()` is incorrect. It should be `emit Withdraw(caller, receiver, owner, assets, shares);`.

> MUST emit the Withdraw event.

> - name: Withdraw
>   type: event
>   inputs:
>     - name: sender
>       indexed: true
>       type: address
>     - name: receiver
>       indexed: true
>       type: address
>     - name: owner
>       indexed: true
>       type: address
>     - name: assets
>       indexed: false
>       type: uint256
>     - name: shares
>       indexed: false
>       type: uint256

```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 _assets, uint256 _shares, address _caller, address _owner, address _receiver) internal {
        require(_shares != 0, "B");

        if (_caller != _owner) {
            _spendAllowance(_owner, _caller, _shares);
        }

        _totalAssets -= _assets;
        _burn(_owner, _shares);
        IERC20(_asset()).safeTransfer(_receiver, _assets);
@>      emit Withdraw(_owner, _receiver, _receiver, _assets, _shares);
    }
```
