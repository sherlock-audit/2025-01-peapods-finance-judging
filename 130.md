# Fee-on-transfer tokens break core accounting in FraxlendPair deposit and collateral functions

### Summary and Impact
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L578

The FraxlendPairCore contract fails to properly account for fee-on-transfer tokens in its deposit and collateral management functions. The protocol assumes the amount transferred equals the specified amount, but for tokens that take a fee on transfer, this assumption is incorrect.

Looking at the documentation and protocol invariants, we can see this violates a core principle of the system: accurate accounting of assets and shares. The protocol documentation emphasizes the importance of precise asset tracking for determining interest rates, liquidation thresholds, and collateralization ratios.

This vulnerability affects any markets created with fee-on-transfer tokens as either the asset or collateral token. When users interact with these markets, the protocol will record incorrect balances, leading to unfair share distribution and potentially incorrect liquidation calculations.

### Vulnerability Details
The core issue lies in how the FraxlendPair handles token transfers. Let's examine the `_deposit` function in FraxlendPairCore.sol:

```solidity
function _deposit(
    VaultAccount memory _totalAsset,
    uint128 _amount,
    uint128 _shares,
    address _receiver,
    bool _shouldTransfer
) internal {
    // Effects: bookkeeping
    _totalAsset.amount += _amount;  // Uses pre-fee amount
    _totalAsset.shares += _shares;  // Shares based on pre-fee amount

    // Effects: write back to storage
    _mint(_receiver, _shares);
    totalAsset = _totalAsset;

    // Interactions
    if (_shouldTransfer) {
        assetContract.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    }
}
```

The function performs accounting before the actual transfer and assumes the full amount is received. However, with a fee-on-transfer token that takes, say, 2% on each transfer:

1. A user deposits 100 tokens
2. The protocol records 100 tokens in `_totalAsset.amount`
3. The actual transfer only yields 98 tokens to the contract
4. The user receives shares for 100 tokens despite only contributing 98

Here's a proof of concept demonstrating the issue:

```solidity
function testFeeTokenDeposit() public {
    // Setup: Deploy pair with MockFeeToken(2% fee)
    uint256 depositAmount = 100e18;
    
    // Initial state
    uint256 initialBalance = pair.totalAssets();
    
    // User deposits 100 tokens
    vm.startPrank(user);
    feeToken.approve(address(pair), depositAmount);
    uint256 sharesMinted = pair.deposit(depositAmount, user);
    
    // Verify discrepancy
    uint256 actualDeposit = pair.totalAssets() - initialBalance;
    assertLt(actualDeposit, depositAmount); // Actual deposit is less than recorded
    
    // But shares were minted for full amount
    uint256 expectedShares = pair.toAssetShares(depositAmount, false);
    assertEq(sharesMinted, expectedShares); // Shares minted for pre-fee amount
}
```

The same issue exists in collateral handling:
```solidity
function _addCollateral(address _sender, uint256 _collateralAmount, address _borrower) internal {
    userCollateralBalance[_borrower] += _collateralAmount;  // Pre-fee amount
    totalCollateral += _collateralAmount;                   // Pre-fee amount
    
    collateralContract.safeTransferFrom(_sender, address(this), _collateralAmount);
}
```
