# `_swapForRewards` can make the contract insolvent

### Summary

`_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` can be overwritten to `REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN` which if a bigger value would cause insolvency

### Root Cause

The catch overrides `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` to be `REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN`, when we are `_amountIn / 2 < REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN `

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L313-L318
```solidity
        } catch {
            _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride = _amountIn / 2 < REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN 
                ? REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN 
                : _amountIn / 2;

            IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
            emit RewardSwapError(_amountIn);
        }
```

However if we are way bellow this value it can turn out `REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN > _amountIn`. And since we have set `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` already, the next time we invoke `_swapForRewards` we would enter the bellow case and possably fail the swap if `REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN` is still bigger than our initial `_amountIn`. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L293-L297
```solidity
    function _swapForRewards(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountOut, uint256 _adminAmt) internal {
        if (_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride > 0) {
            _adminAmt = (_adminAmt * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountOut = (_amountOut * _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride) / _amountIn;
            _amountIn = _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride;
        }
```

Even worse than a failed TX would be the case of insolvency, where there are enough balances to go for the swap, but the non-distributed rewards, aka `_amountIn` is smaller than `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride`, which would pass the swap, but spend some of the rewards, which were accrued prev. cycles.

### Attack Path

1. We calculate `_amountTkn` to be 40
```solidity
        uint256 _unclaimedPairedLpTkns = rewardsDeposited[PAIRED_LP_TOKEN] - rewardsDistributed[PAIRED_LP_TOKEN];
        
        uint256 _amountTkn = IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).balanceOf(address(this)) - _unclaimedPairedLpTkns;
```

2. Perform a swap, but fail, entering the `catch` and saving the new `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride` to 100 (we are on ETH and gas may be a few bucks so, it won't be profitable if we swap 10 or 20 USD worth of tokens)

```solidity
        } catch {
            _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride = _amountIn / 2 < REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN 
                ? REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN 
                : _amountIn / 2;

            IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
            emit RewardSwapError(_amountIn);
        }
```

3. Next time when `depositFromPairedLpToken` calculates `_amountTkn` to be 90 tokens
4.  We enter `_swapForRewards` and set the new swapped amount to `_rewardsSwapAmountInOverride`- 100 tokens

5. The initial calculation for this was that we had 1000 LP tokens, but 910 were unclaimed, meaning that we have the balance to execute the swap
```solidity
// 1000 - 910 = 90
uint256 _amountTkn = IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).balanceOf(address(this)) - _unclaimedPairedLpTkns;
```
6. The swap is executed, which causes insolvency in our `PAIRED_LP_TOKEN` as we have swapped more of it than there are `_unclaimedPairedLpTkns` ones, meaning that if all of the users who have it as a reward token try to claim it, they won't be able to, as contract balance is 900, but `_unclaimedPairedLpTkns` is 910.

This scenario will prob. occur multiple times, and can even be provoked by a malicious user if he just calls `depositFromPairedLpToken` 2 times in a row and reverts to 1st swap to enter the catch (can be pool price manipulation or anything else, doesn't matter how he reverts it).



### Impact

Insolvency, last user/users not being able to claim their rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider redesigning this whole function. The concept of min swap is useful, but make sure to check our existing amount if they are enough to perform the swap.
