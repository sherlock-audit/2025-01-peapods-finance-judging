# Incorrect Fee Deduction in `_tokenToPodLp` Can Lead to Irrecoverable User Fund Loss

In the [_tokenToPodLp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L233-L247) function, the contract deducts protocol fees before ensuring a successful conversion of `_pairedOut` to `_lpAmtOut`. Specifically, the fee is calculated and subtracted from `_pairedOut` before calling `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp(_pairedOut, _deadline)`, which is responsible for swapping paired LP tokens into Pod LP tokens. If `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` fails due to slippage, insufficient liquidity, or oracle pricing issues, the deducted fee is never refunded to the user, leading to a permanent loss of funds. Also, `_protocolFees` is updated based on an assumed successful transaction, potentially leading to incorrect protocol fee balances. The problematic code snippet is:  

```solidity
    function _tokenToPodLp(address _token, uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountLpOutMin, uint256 _deadline)
        internal
        returns (uint256 _lpAmtOut)
    {
        uint256 _pairedOut = _tokenToPairedLpToken(_token, _amountIn);
        if (_pairedOut > 0) {
            uint256 _pairedFee = (_pairedOut * protocolFee) / 1000;
            if (_pairedFee > 0) {
                _protocolFees += _pairedFee;
                _pairedOut -= _pairedFee;
            }
            _lpAmtOut = _pairedLpTokenToPodLp(_pairedOut, _deadline);
            require(_lpAmtOut >= _amountLpOutMin, "M");
        }
    }
```
Here, `_pairedFee` is deducted before confirming that `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` successfully converts `_pairedOut` to `_lpAmtOut`, causing a discrepancy where fees are lost if the function reverts or returns zero.  

## Impact  
User funds can be permanently lost if the `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` function fails, as the deducted fee is neither refunded nor properly accounted for.  

## Mitigation
Ensure fee deduction occurs only after `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` successfully returns a nonzero `_lpAmtOut`, preventing loss in case of transaction failure.
