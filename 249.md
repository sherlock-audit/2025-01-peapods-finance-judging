# Users can abuse the 63/64 rule to get a share of rewards they shouldn't

### Summary

Users can abuse the 63/64 rule to get a share of rewards they shouldn't

### Root Cause

The try/catch mechanism allows for a 63/64 abuse in `TokenRewards`. When swapping rewards during the `depositFromPairedLpToken()` flow, we have this code as the __last__ operation:
```solidity
        try
            DEX_ADAPTER.swapV3Single(...)
        {
            ...
        } catch {
            _rewardsSwapAmountInOverride = _amountIn / 2 < REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN ? REWARDS_SWAP_OVERRIDE_MIN : _amountIn / 2;
            IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeDecreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _amountIn);
            emit RewardSwapError(_amountIn);
        }
```
Users can send enough gas to reach the swap, fail due to OOG and we will have 1/64 of the remaining gas to finish the catch block which will be successful as it is 2 simple operations.

### Attack Path

1. There are 1e18 of pending tokens to be added as rewards:
```solidity
uint256 _amountTkn = IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).balanceOf(address(this)) - _unclaimedPairedLpTkns;
```
2. User does 30 consecutive __BUT__ separate transactions (separate as in different gas meters used so we can abuse the 63/64 rule for each of them) where each of them results in the case explained in the root cause section, after 30 such transactions, we will reach the minimum override amount of 1e9 (1e9 for 18 decimal tokens) due to the `catch` block logic. This should occur in a low gas fee chain such as Base where doing this won't result in a huge cost for the attacker
3. User now stakes normally which processes the 1e9 rewards and swaps them, now there are `1e18 - 1e9` rewards to process __BUT__ the user is already staked, he will get a share of them
4. User processes the remaining `1e18 - 1e9` (which is pretty much 1e18) and gets a share of them as if he had a stake from before that, this is unintended, leads to a profit for him, leads to a loss of funds for other users and breaks the main idea of a staking mechanism

### Impact

Loss of funds for users, unfair profit for the malicious user and breaks the main idea of a staking mechanism.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make sure that there is enough gas to complete the swap and revert otherwise.
