# Protocol will Break If `maxVaults' is set Below The Current Number

### Summary

A mistake in the contract's design will cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for users as the owner will reduce `maxVaults` below the current number of whitelisted vaults, preventing new vaults from being added.

### Root Cause

In [LendingAssetVault.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L338-342) :: `setMaxVaults(uint8 _newMax)`, there is no validation to ensure that the new value of `maxVaults` is not less than the current number of whitelisted vaults. This allows the owner to set `maxVaults` to a value lower than the existing count of whitelisted vaults, creating an inconsistent state where the contract enforces the limit strictly but does not automatically unwhitelist excess vaults.

```solidity
function setMaxVaults(uint8 _newMax) external onlyOwner {
    uint8 _oldMax = maxVaults;
    maxVaults = _newMax;
    emit SetMaxVaults(_oldMax, _newMax);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Owner needs to call `setMaxVaults()` to set `maxVaults` to be less than the current number of whitelisted vaults.
2. The number of whitelisted vaults must be greater than the new value of `maxVaults`.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Owner calls `setMaxVaults(uint8 _newMax)` with a value lower than the current number of whitelisted vaults.
2. The contract updates `maxVaults` but does not unwhitelist any vaults, leaving the number of whitelisted vaults greater than `maxVaults`.
3. When a user attempts to whitelist a new vault by calling `setVaultWhitelist(address _vault, bool _allowed)`, the contract reverts with the message "M" because the number of whitelisted vaults exceeds `maxVaults`.

Note: Because this logic error requires the owner to execute the likely hood is medium and impact is high because it causes a DoS

### Impact

The users cannot whitelist new vaults, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This prevents legitimate users from interacting with the contract and limits the protocol's functionality. Additionally, the inconsistent state between `maxVaults` and the actual number of whitelisted vaults introduces operational complexity and potential governance challenges.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_setMaxVaultsBelowCurrentDanger() public {
        // 1. Initial Setup: Allow 10 vaults
        _lendingAssetVault.setMaxVaults(10);

        // 2. Add 10 vaults
        address[] memory vaults = new address[](10);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            TestERC4626Vault newVault = new TestERC4626Vault(address(_asset));
            address vaultAddr = address(newVault);
            vaults[i] = vaultAddr;
            _lendingAssetVault.setVaultWhitelist(vaultAddr, true);
            console.log("Vaults: ", i);
        }

        // 3. Reduce maxVaults to 6
        _lendingAssetVault.setMaxVaults(6);

        // 4. Verify contract still has 10 whitelisted vaults
        address[] memory whitelisted = _lendingAssetVault.getAllWhitelistedVaults();
        console.log("Number of whitelisted: ", whitelisted.length);
        assertEq(whitelisted.length, 10, "Should retain 10 vaults after max reduction");

        // 5. Test new additions are blocked
        TestERC4626Vault newVault11 = new TestERC4626Vault(address(_asset));
        vm.expectRevert(); // Use correct error encoding
        _lendingAssetVault.setVaultWhitelist(address(newVault11), true);

        // 6. Remove one vault (now 9 left)
        _lendingAssetVault.setVaultWhitelist(vaults[0], false);

        // 7. Verify system remains broken
        vm.expectRevert(); // Still can't add new vaults
        _lendingAssetVault.setVaultWhitelist(address(newVault11), true);

        // 8. Demonstrate DoS: Remove enough vaults to fall below maxVaults
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
            _lendingAssetVault.setVaultWhitelist(vaults[i], false);
        }

        // 9. Verify adding a new vault is now allowed
        _lendingAssetVault.setVaultWhitelist(address(newVault11), true);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Validate to make sure the `newMaxVault` is greater than the current `maxVaults`:

```diff
function setMaxVaults(uint8 _newMax) external onlyOwner {
+   require(_newMax >= _vaultWhitelistAry.length, "Cannot reduce maxVaults below current count");
    uint8 _oldMax = maxVaults;
    maxVaults = _newMax;
    emit SetMaxVaults(_oldMax, _newMax);
}
```
