# Interest rate can be manipulated by regular deposit calls

### Summary

Interest rate can be manipulated by regular deposit calls

### Root Cause

In [Variable Interest Rate calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/VariableInterestRate.sol#L115), interest rate is updated based on the utilization ratio and it uses a specific formula for the calculation.

If the utilization is higher than desired value, it increases the interest rate and if the utilization is lower than the desired value, it lowers the interest in order to adjust. 

The issue is users can intentionally manipulate the interest rate adjustment by calling low gas cost functions regularly and they can get extra advantage for themselves.

```solidity
    function getFullUtilizationInterest(uint256 _deltaTime, uint256 _utilization, uint64 _fullUtilizationInterest)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint64 _newFullUtilizationInterest)
    {
        if (_utilization < MIN_TARGET_UTIL) {
            // 18 decimals
            uint256 _deltaUtilization = ((MIN_TARGET_UTIL - _utilization) * 1e18) / MIN_TARGET_UTIL;
            // 36 decimals
            uint256 _decayGrowth = (RATE_HALF_LIFE * 1e36) + (_deltaUtilization * _deltaUtilization * _deltaTime); 
            // 18 decimals
            _newFullUtilizationInterest = uint64((_fullUtilizationInterest * (RATE_HALF_LIFE * 1e36)) / _decayGrowth);
        } else if (_utilization > MAX_TARGET_UTIL) {
            // 18 decimals
            uint256 _deltaUtilization = ((_utilization - MAX_TARGET_UTIL) * 1e18) / (UTIL_PREC - MAX_TARGET_UTIL);
            // 36 decimals
            uint256 _decayGrowth = (RATE_HALF_LIFE * 1e36) + (_deltaUtilization * _deltaUtilization * _deltaTime);
            // 18 decimals
            _newFullUtilizationInterest = uint64((_fullUtilizationInterest * _decayGrowth) / (RATE_HALF_LIFE * 1e36));
        } else {
            _newFullUtilizationInterest = _fullUtilizationInterest;
        }
        if (_newFullUtilizationInterest > MAX_FULL_UTIL_RATE) {
            _newFullUtilizationInterest = uint64(MAX_FULL_UTIL_RATE);
        } else if (_newFullUtilizationInterest < MIN_FULL_UTIL_RATE) {
            _newFullUtilizationInterest = uint64(MIN_FULL_UTIL_RATE);
        }
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Utilization should be higher than max value or lower than min value

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

1. Let say utilization ratio is high because it's self lending pod
2. Normally, the interest is updated in actions and if there is no lender, the interest will be increased in time
3. Instead of waiting this adjustment, lender can supply his tokens and he can regularly call `depositCollateral` function which is cheap to execute and it also updates the interest rate.
4. With that methodology, interest rate will be increased much faster than normal execution because of compounding effect.
5. With that way, lender will earn much more than he should

### Impact

In provided scenario, both lenders and borrowers can manipulate the interest rate with regular deposit collateral calls and they can get extra advantage against the opposite side. It will be loss of funds for the opposite side due to unfair interest adjustment.
