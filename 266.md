# Whitelist Actions Should Update All Vaults


### Summary
In LendingAssetVault.sol, Guardian::H02 issue is not mitigated.

### Root Cause
This issue is marked `Resolved`. However, this issue is not mitigated.

Asset availability changes during `whitelistDeposit` and `whitelistWithdraw`. 
But, in these functions only the vault that is calling is updated with `_updateAssetMetadataFromVault`. 
Instead, all whitelisted vaults should be updated too which affects their interest calculations.

### PoC
Consider this example:
• LAV has 150 DAI
• Two Vaults A & B, with a 100 max allocation from LAV respectively.
• Both Vault A & B have whitelist withdrawn 50 DAI and lend 50 DAI, 
    In LendingAssetVault: vaultUtilization[A] = vaultUtilization[B] = 50.
    InFraxlendPairCor: totalAvailable = 50 + 50 = 100.
    so utilization rates are 50 / (50 + 50) = 50% 
• 1 day passes
• A new borrower borrows 50 DAI from Vault A, so Vault A whitelist withdrawn 50 DAI and utilization rate increases from 50 to 100%.
• Available assets are also reduced for vault B, its utilization rate will increase to 50 / (50 + 0) = 100%

In the example above, the next time accrued interest in Vault B is calculated, it assumes a 100% utilization rate for the entire duration since the last update.
Instead, it should have been a 50% utilization (lower interest rate) for 1 day and then the 100% utilization rate after the borrow from Vault A. 
Borrowers will therefore always be incorrectly charged for interest across all whitelisted vaults.

### Impact
Borrowers will therefore always be incorrectly charged for interest across all whitelisted vaults.

### Mitigation
whitelistDeposit and whitelistWithdraw should update all vaults by calling _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(adress(0)):

```diff
    function whitelistDeposit(uint256 _assetAmt) external override onlyWhitelist {
        address _vault = _msgSender();
-        _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
+        _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(adress(0));
        vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _assetAmt > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultDeposits[_vault] : _assetAmt;
        vaultUtilization[_vault] -= _assetAmt;
        _totalAssetsUtilized -= _assetAmt;
        IERC20(_asset).safeTransferFrom(_vault, address(this), _assetAmt);
        emit WhitelistDeposit(_vault, _assetAmt);
    }
```
