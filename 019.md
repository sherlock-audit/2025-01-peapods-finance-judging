# User can evade _fees.debond

### Summary

A user having >=99% holding of pTKNs can evade debond Fee.

### Root Cause

In WeightedIndex::debond [L-176](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L176) the check for whether the user is the _Last One Out_ ,the function [_isLastOut](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L281-L283) contains a bug. It allows anybody having >=99% of _totalSupply holding  debond without any fee.

### Attack Path

Alice is an arbitrageur gleaning profits by big amount of wrapping and unwrapping TKNs. While market volatility unwrapping(debonding(pTKN==>TKN)) becomes profitable and everyone tends to unwrap. Since Alice has got a very large holding, she waits a bit and notices her holding is ~99% of the _totalSupply , and debonds her holding without giving any fees even after lots of person have still got holdings. **(This Protocol allows only the last person to debond without fee.)**

### Impact

The protocol suffers a  large amount of fees(~1% of debond amount) (since the user debonds very large amount).

### PoC

```solidity
    function test_debondMultipleUsers() public {
        console.log("Initial Peas Balance of alice: ", peas.balanceOf(alice));
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        pod.bond(address(peas), bondAmt, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
        //initial setup for 99 users
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 99; i++) {
            address user = address(uint160(4 + i));
            deal(address(peas), user, bondAmt / 500);
            vm.startPrank(user);
            peas.approve(address(pod), type(uint256).max);
            vm.stopPrank();
            vm.startPrank(user);
            pod.bond(address(peas), bondAmt / 10000, 0);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        uint256 aliceInitialBalance = pod.balanceOf(alice);

        console.log("Before debond Balance of alice : ", aliceInitialBalance);
        console.log("Total Supply: ", pod.totalSupply());

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        address[] memory _n1;
        uint8[] memory _n2;
        pod.debond(aliceInitialBalance, _n1, _n2);
        vm.stopPrank();

        console.log("Final Balance of alice : ", peas.balanceOf(alice));
     }
```
```solidity
Logs:
  Initial Peas Balance of alice:  100000000000000000000  
  Before debond Balance of alice :  1000000000000000000  
  Total Supply:  1009899999999999901
  Final Balance of alice :  99999999999999999999(1 loss due to rounding error)
```

### Mitigation

Users can be listed through a mapping, every time an user debonds should be out from the list. And only the last person will be given the debond fee Free benefit.
