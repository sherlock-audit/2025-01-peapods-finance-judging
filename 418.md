# StaticOracle not  available mode,base,bera

### Summary

The contract may not work as expected on mode,base,bera due to hard-coded  StaticOracle.

### Root Cause

```solidity
        uint256 _price1 = IStaticOracle(0xB210CE856631EeEB767eFa666EC7C1C57738d438).quoteSpecificPoolsWithTimePeriod(
            ORACLE_PRECISION, BASE_TOKEN, QUOTE_TOKEN, _pools, TWAP_DURATION
        );
```

in `DualOracleChainlinkUniV3` contract the function `getPrice` used to return two prices from different oracles, however the StaticOracle address is hard-coded to `0xB210CE856631EeEB767eFa666EC7C1C57738d438` since it only available on Ethereum, Arbitrum One.
 this will make the function not work will the contract is will be deployed on Base, Mode, Berachain.
