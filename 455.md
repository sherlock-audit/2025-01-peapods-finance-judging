# LendingAssetVault is not EIP4626 compliant


### Summary

LendingAssetVault is not EIP4626 compliant. In fact, it violates a lot of the EIP4626 specs.

### Root Cause

First, the README explicitly states ERC4626 should be complied to:

> Q: Is the codebase expected to comply with any specific EIPs?
> 
> Many of our contracts implement ERC20 and ERC4626 which we attempt to comply with in the entirety of those standards for contracts that implement them.

According to the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626,

1. `mint` and `previewMint` should always overestimate (should round up). Currently it rounds down.

> If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round up.

```solidity
    function convertToAssets(uint256 _shares) public view override returns (uint256 _assets) {
        _assets = (_shares * _cbr()) / PRECISION;
    }

    function _previewConvertToAssets(uint256 _shares) internal view returns (uint256 _assets) {
        _assets = (_shares * _previewCbr()) / PRECISION;
    }

    function previewMint(uint256 _shares) external view override returns (uint256 _assets) {
        _assets = _previewConvertToAssets(_shares);
    }

    function mint(uint256 _shares, address _receiver) external override returns (uint256 _assets) {
        _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(address(0));
        _assets = convertToAssets(_shares);
        _deposit(_assets, _shares, _receiver);
    }
```

Users can also use this incorrect rounding to mint free shares (only a couple wei though).

2. `withdraw` and `previewWithdraw` should always overestimate (should round up). Currently it rounds down.

> If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round up.


```solidity
    function convertToShares(uint256 _assets) public view override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _shares = (_assets * PRECISION) / _cbr();
    }

    function _previewConvertToShares(uint256 _assets) internal view returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _shares = (_assets * PRECISION) / _previewCbr();
    }

    function previewWithdraw(uint256 _assets) external view override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _shares = _previewConvertToShares(_assets);
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 _assets, address _receiver, address _owner) external override returns (uint256 _shares) {
        _updateInterestAndMdInAllVaults(address(0));
        _shares = convertToShares(_assets);
        _withdraw(_shares, _assets, _owner, _msgSender(), _receiver);
    }
```

Users can also use this incorrect rounding to withdraw free assets (only a couple wei though).

3. Event of `_withdraw()` is incorrect. It should be `emit Withdraw(caller, receiver, owner, assets, shares);`.

> MUST emit the Withdraw event.

> - name: Withdraw
>   type: event
>   inputs:
>     - name: sender
>       indexed: true
>       type: address
>     - name: receiver
>       indexed: true
>       type: address
>     - name: owner
>       indexed: true
>       type: address
>     - name: assets
>       indexed: false
>       type: uint256
>     - name: shares
>       indexed: false
>       type: uint256

```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 _shares, uint256 _assets, address _owner, address _caller, address _receiver) internal {
        if (_caller != _owner) {
            _spendAllowance(_owner, _caller, _shares);
        }
        uint256 _totalAvailable = totalAvailableAssets();
        _totalAssets -= _assets;

        require(_totalAvailable >= _assets, "AV");
        _burn(_owner, _shares);
        IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_receiver, _assets);
@>      emit Withdraw(_owner, _receiver, _receiver, _assets, _shares);
    }
```

4. `previewDeposit`, `previewMint` may be a lot different from `deposit`, `mint`, because preview functions always calculates with the latest FraxlendPair interest, but `deposit`, `mint` may trigger the cache logic and not use latest interest.

> MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be minted in a deposit call in the same transaction. I.e. deposit should return the same or more shares as previewDeposit if called in the same transaction.

```solidity
            // @audit-bug: The cache logic does not exist in previewDeposit().
@>          (uint256 _interestEarned,,,,,) = IFraxlendPair(_vault).addInterest(false);
            if (_interestEarned > 0) {
                _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
            }
```

### Impact

1. Integrators may have trouble integrating as ERC4626.
2. Users can mint free shares and withdraw free assets (up to a couple of wei).
