# `whitelistWithdraw()` will make the `mapping vaultUtilization` smaller, thus making breaking the invariant of `cbr` going only up and never down

### Summary

In Sherlock's contest page, it is said that the `cbr` should only go up, which is basically the ratio of assets vs shares (simplified).

But in `whitelistWithdraw()`, the `mapping vaultUtilization` is going to be changed, which is one of the values used when calculating `_totalAssets` in `_updateAssetMetadataFromVault()` as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L303).

This will cause the `_totalAssets` to become smaller every single time `whitelistWithdraw()` is invoked, thus breaking the invariant that the `cbr` is going only and only up

### Root Cause

The root cause is that `whitelistWithdraw()` makes the `mapping vaultUtilization` bigger without any minting of shares, thus making the `_totalAssets` smaller when `_updateAssetMetadataFromVault()` is called -> causing a broken invariant

### Internal Pre-conditions

`whitelistWithdraw()` needs to be called

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Whitelisted Alice calls `whitelistWithdraw()` passing an arbitrary value, causing the `mapping vaultUtilization` to become bigger
2. Non-whitelisted Bob decides to call `deposit()`, but founds out that he is getting a smaller value than expected due to a bigger `cbr` caused by a bigger `_totalAssets` resulting from the call in the first step of the attack path.

### Impact

Broken invariant when `whitelistWithdraw()` is called - medium severity.
