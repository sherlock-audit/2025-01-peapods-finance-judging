# Over-Burning Due to Mismatched Token Transfer Amounts

### Summary

The [`_processInboundTokens function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/ccip/TokenBridge.sol#L104) in  TokenBridge.sol burns _amount instead of _amountAfter. If the actual received amount (_amountAfter) is less than the intended amount (_amount), the contract may attempt to burn more tokens than it actually received.

### Root Cause

The  [`_processInboundTokens function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/ccip/TokenBridge.sol#L104) assumes that _amount (the intended transfer amount) is always fully received. However, ERC-20 token transfers might involve:

Fee-on-Transfer Tokens – Some tokens deduct a fee, so the contract receives less than _amount.
Incorrect Allowance or Insufficient Balance – If _user has insufficient balance or allowance, the transfer may partially fail or succeed with a lower amount.
Since _amount is used for burning instead of _amountAfter, the contract may attempt to burn more tokens than it actually received. This can lead to failed transactions or unintended token destruction.

### Attack Path

### Impact

##### Excessive Token Burning Leading to Losses or Failure
Failed Transactions: If _amount is greater than _amountAfter (actual received amount), the burn call may fail due to insufficient balance in the contract. This could prevent token bridging from functioning properly.
Denial of Service (DoS) Risk: If this issue causes repeated transaction failures, users may be unable to bridge tokens.

### Mitigation

``` 
if (_isMintBurn) {
        IERC20Bridgeable(_token).burn(_amountAfter); // Use _amountAfter instead of _amount
    }
```
