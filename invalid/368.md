# Solvency Check After Execution Vulnerability

### Summary

The  [`FraxlendPairCore.sol:: modifier isSolvent`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L242)

 
```
modifier isSolvent(address _borrower) {
        _;
        ExchangeRateInfo memory _exchangeRateInfo = exchangeRateInfo;

        if (!_isSolvent(_borrower, _exchangeRateInfo.highExchangeRate)) {
            revert Insolvent(
                totalBorrow.toAmount(userBorrowShares[_borrower], true),
                userCollateralBalance[_borrower],
                _exchangeRateInfo.highExchangeRate
            );
        }
    }

```


This setup allows for potential exploitation where attackers could:
Manipulate Solvency: Temporarily adjust their collateral or debt to appear solvent during the check but revert to an insolvent state immediately after. This  involve using flash loans to borrow assets, use them to meet solvency criteria, execute the function, and then repay the loan, leaving the position insolvent.
Flash Loan Attacks: Specifically, this timing vulnerability makes the contract susceptible to flash loan attacks where an attacker borrows funds, manipulates their position to pass the solvency check, executes actions like withdrawals or further borrowing, then repays the loan, leaving the protocol with an insolvent position

### Root Cause

The isSolvent modifier checks whether a borrower is solvent after the execution of the function's body (_; before the check). This means that any state changes or operations that affect the borrower's solvency status occur before the solvency is verified

* Check-Effects-Interactions Pattern Violation

### Internal Pre-conditions

Solvency Modifier Structure:
```
modifier isSolvent(address _borrower) {
    _;  // Function body executes here
    if (!_isSolvent(_borrower, exchangeRateInfo.highExchangeRate)) {
        revert Insolvent(...);
    }
}
```

The placement of _; before the solvency check (_isSolvent) is the primary internal pre-condition enabling this vulnerability/ bug

### External Pre-conditions

* Flash Loan Availability
* Market Liquidity

* Price Oracle Vulnerabilities:
    Delayed or Inaccurate Price Data
* Network Conditions:
     Transaction Speed

### Attack Path

Identify the Target Function:
Prepare the Flash Loan
Pass the Solvency Check

Revert the Manipulation:
After passing the solvency check, the attacker:
Removes or reduces the collateral back to its original state or less



### Impact

Accumulation of Bad Debt

Loss of Funds

Revenue Impact:
The protocol  miss out on interest income or fees if positions become unmanageable or if users withdraw due to security concerns.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reorder the Solvency Check

modifier isSolvent(address _borrower) {
    if (!_isSolvent(_borrower, exchangeRateInfo.highExchangeRate)) {
        revert Insolvent(...);
    }
    _;
}
