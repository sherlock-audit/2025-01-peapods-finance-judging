# depositToVault Deposit Occurs Before Allocation Check

### Summary

The [`depositToVault function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L312C1-L315C79) in `LendingAssetVault contract`allows the LendingAssetVault owner to deposit assets into vault before checking if the whitelisted vault has sufficient allocation. This allows deposits exceeding the allocated limit, breaking the core allocation management logic.  This is a flaw that can lead to loss of funds for the LendingAssetVault.

### Root Cause

 misordering of operations in the depositToVault function.
```solidity
 _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
        IERC20(_asset).safeIncreaseAllowance(_vault, _amountAssets);
        uint256 _amountShares = IERC4626(_vault).deposit(_amountAssets, address(this));
        require(totalAvailableAssetsForVault(_vault) >= _amountAssets, "MAX");
```
 validation checks are placed after state-changing operations instead of before them

### Attack Path

### Impact

##### lost of funds
  Because the depositToVault function allows deposits beyond the whitelisted vault's allocation, the LendingAssetVault can effectively lose control of assets

 The system might become unbalanced, making it difficult to manage risk and ensure fair distribution of assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Correcting  the order of operations within the depositToVault function to ensure the allocation check happens before the deposit is attempted
```  _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
 require(totalAvailableAssetsForVault(_vault) >= _amountAssets, "MAX"); // Allocation check FIRST
 IERC20(_asset).safeIncreaseAllowance(_vault, _amountAssets); // Allowance increase ONLY if check passes
 uint256 _amountShares = IERC4626(_vault).deposit(_amountAssets, address(this)); // Deposit ONLY if check passes
```
