# whitelistWithdraw/whitelistDeposit:  Inverted Accounting Breaks System Integrity

### Summary

The [`whitelistWithdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L231-L241) and [`whitelistDeposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L248-L250) functions contain a critical accounting error. They incorrectly update the vaultDeposits and vaultUtilization variables, leading to an inversion of the intended logic

* `whitelistWithdraw`: Instead of decreasing vaultDeposits and vaultUtilization when a whitelisted vault withdraws assets, it increases them.
* `whitelistDeposit`: Instead of increasing vaultDeposits and vaultUtilization when a whitelisted vault deposits assets, it decreases them.


### Root Cause

there is  fundamental logical error in how the functions update the vaultDeposits and vaultUtilization variables.  The code implements the opposite of the intended behavior.

whitelistWithdraw: When a whitelisted vault withdraws assets, its recorded deposits and utilization within the LendingAssetVault should decrease.  The code increases the vault's deposits and utilization, which is the opposite of what should happen during a withdrawal
```
  function whitelistWithdraw(uint256 _assetAmt) external override onlyWhitelist {
        address _vault = _msgSender();
        _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);

        // validate max after doing vault accounting above
        require(totalAvailableAssetsForVault(_vault) >= _assetAmt, "MAX");
        vaultDeposits[_vault] += _assetAmt;
        vaultUtilization[_vault] += _assetAmt;
        _totalAssetsUtilized += _assetAmt;
        IERC20(_asset).safeTransfer(_vault, _assetAmt);
        emit WhitelistWithdraw(_vault, _assetAmt);
    }
```


whitelistDeposit: When a whitelisted vault deposits assets, its recorded deposits and utilization within the LendingAssetVault should increase. The code decreases the vault's deposits and utilization, which is the opposite of what should happen during a deposit
```
function whitelistDeposit(uint256 _assetAmt) external override onlyWhitelist {
        address _vault = _msgSender();
        _updateAssetMetadataFromVault(_vault);
        vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _assetAmt > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultDeposits[_vault] : _assetAmt;
        vaultUtilization[_vault] -= _assetAmt;
        _totalAssetsUtilized -= _assetAmt;
        IERC20(_asset).safeTransferFrom(_vault, address(this), _assetAmt);
        emit WhitelistDeposit(_vault, _assetAmt);
    }
```
