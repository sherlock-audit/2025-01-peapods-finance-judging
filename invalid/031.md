# Fee Deduction Before Loan Execution Can Lead to User Loss

### Summary


The [`flash function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L406) collects the flash loan fee before transferring the borrowed tokens to the recipient:
```solidity
        IERC20(DAI).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), _feeRecipient, FLASH_FEE_AMOUNT_DAI);
```
If the flash loan transfer fails (due to insufficient liquidity, reverts in recipient callback, or other reasons), the borrower still loses the fee without receiving the loaned funds.

The problem is the order of these operations. The fee collection should happen after the flash loan is successfully completed .  This would ensure that the fee is only paid if the loan actually goes through.

### Impact

User Loss of Funds:

Direct Financial Loss: Users can lose the DAI fee (FLASH_FEE_AMOUNT_DAI) even if the flash loan transaction fails.  This is a direct financial loss for the user, even though it's not a direct loss for the protocol itself.

Unintended Cost: Users are effectively paying a fee for attempting a flash loan, not for successfully completing one. This is likely not the intended behavior and can lead to a negative user experience.

Malicious users can exploit this by repeatedly initiating flash loans, having the DAI fee collected, and then reverting the transaction (e.g., in the callback).  This allows them to "steal" DAI fees from other users without ever borrowing any tokens.

### PoC

### Mitigation

ensure that fee is collected after token transfer

```

function flash(address _recipient, address _token, uint256 _amount, bytes calldata _data) external override lock {
    require(_isTokenInIndex[_token], "X");
    address _rewards = IStakingPoolToken(lpStakingPool).POOL_REWARDS();
    address _feeRecipient = lpRewardsToken == DAI
        ? address(this)
        : PAIRED_LP_TOKEN == DAI ? _rewards : Ownable(address(V3_TWAP_UTILS)).owner();

    uint256 _balance = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));

    IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_recipient, _amount);

    IFlashLoanRecipient(_recipient).callback(_data);

    require(IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) >= _balance, "FA");

    // Fee collection moved AFTER token transfer and checks
    IERC20(DAI).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), _feeRecipient, FLASH_FEE_AMOUNT_DAI); 

    if (lpRewardsToken == DAI) {
        IERC20(DAI).safeIncreaseAllowance(_rewards, FLASH_FEE_AMOUNT_DAI);
        ITokenRewards(_rewards).depositRewards(DAI, FLASH_FEE_AMOUNT_DAI);
    } else if (PAIRED_LP_TOKEN == DAI) {
        ITokenRewards(_rewards).depositFromPairedLpToken(0);
    }

    emit FlashLoan(_msgSender(), _recipient, _token, _amount);
}
