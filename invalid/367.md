# Inadequate Liquidation Handling for Positions in Dead Zones

### Summary

The  FraxlendPairCore::liquidation creates a scenario where certain positions become stuck in a "dead zone", where they are neither eligible for clean nor dirty liquidation. 

```
  if (_leftoverCollateral <= 0) {
    // Determine if we need to adjust any shares
    _sharesToAdjust = _borrowerShares - _sharesToLiquidate;
    if (_sharesToAdjust > 0) {
        // Write off bad debt
        _amountToAdjust = (_totalBorrow.toAmount(_sharesToAdjust, false)).toUint128();

        // Note: Ensure this memory struct will be passed to _repayAsset for write to state
        _totalBorrow.amount -= _amountToAdjust;

        // Effects: write to state
        totalAsset.amount -= _amountToAdjust;
    }
} else if (_leftoverCollateral < minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation.toInt256()) {
    revert BadDirtyLiquidation();
}
```



The else if condition checks if the leftover collateral would be less than minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation but greater than zero. If true, it reverts with BadDirtyLiquidation, indicating that these positions cannot be liquidated, thus creating the dead zone where positions are stuck.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue related to minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation leading to a "dead zone" in the liquidation process. 
This Creates a Range Where Liquidation is Blocked: When the collateral left would be above zero but below this set minimum, no liquidation can proceed, creating a dead zone where positions are neither fully liquidated (clean) nor partially liquidated (dirty)

### Internal Pre-conditions

_addInterest();
This ensures all interest is up to date before calculating liquidation amounts,


(, uint256 _exchangeRate,) = _updateExchangeRate();
The exchange rate between collateral and asset tokens is updated


if (_isSolvent(_borrower, _exchangeRate)) {
    revert BorrowerSolvent();
}
This check ensures the borrower is not solvent before proceeding with liquidation.


Dead Zone Check:

if (_leftoverCollateral < minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation.toInt256()) {
    revert BadDirtyLiquidation();
}
This condition explicitly checks if the position would leave too little collateral after liquidation, leading to the revert if true, thus defining the dead zone.








### External Pre-conditions

User Behavior:
Position Management Practices:


Liquidity of Assets:
Illiquid Collateral



Network Conditions:
Gas Prices and Network Congestion: High transaction costs or slow block times could deter liquidators from managing positions near the dead zone threshold, where the economic incentive might not justify the cost.

### Attack Path

Market Volatility

Network Conditions:
Gas Costs and Network Congestion:

Market Volatility:
Price Fluctuations

### Impact

Accumulation of Bad Debt:
Positions stuck in the dead zone cannot be liquidated, leading to potential bad debt if these positions become or remain insolvent

Revenue Loss:
The protocol misses out on liquidation fees for these positions

Potential for Exploitation:
Attackers might exploit this mechanism by creating positions that would fall into this dead zone, aiming to manipulate the system or accumulate bad debt intentionally.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

i think Partial Liquidation to Minimum:
Modifying the logic to allow for partial liquidations down to minCollateralRequiredOnDirtyLiquidation rather than revertingm will be a very goood practise ..
