# Two-Hop Swap Missing First-Hop _amountOutMin Protection

### Summary


The [`_swapV2 function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L368) in `AutoCompoundingPodLp` handling of two-hop swaps contains a critical flawed logic.  the first swap is executed with _amountOutMin set to 0. This effectively disables slippage protection for the first leg of the swap, exposing users to potentially significant losses if the price of the intermediate token fluctuates unfavorably.  Because the second leg's _amountOutMin is calculated based on the original input amount (not the actual, potentially reduced output from the first swap), the overall swap becomes vulnerable.  This can be exploited by manipulating the price of the intermediate token.

```
  _amountOut =
            DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_path[0], _path[1], _amountIn, _twoHops ? 0 : _amountOutMin, address(this));
        if (_twoHops) {
            uint256 _intermediateBal = _amountOut > 0 ? _amountOut : IERC20(_path[1]).balanceOf(address(this));
            if (maxSwap[_path[1]] > 0 && _intermediateBal > maxSwap[_path[1]]) {
                _intermediateBal = maxSwap[_path[1]];
            }
            IERC20(_path[1]).safeIncreaseAllowance(address(DEX_ADAPTER), _intermediateBal);
            _amountOut = DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single(_path[1], _path[2], _intermediateBal, _amountOutMin, address(this));
        }

### Root Cause

unconditional use of 0 as _amountOutMin for the first hop of a two-hop swap.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_twoHops is true: The swap being attempted must be a two-hop swap. The vulnerability is only present in two-hop swaps, not single-hop swaps

Price Volatility

Uniswap V2 Pool Existence: The relevant Uniswap V2 pools for the swap path must exist and have sufficient liquidity

### External Pre-conditions

Malicious Actor (or Market Conditions):  A malicious actor is not strictly required, but they can significantly amplify the exploit.  The vulnerability can also manifest due to normal market volatility

Knowledge of the Vulnerability

Ability to Trade: The attacker needs to have the capital and means to trade on the Uniswap V2 pools involved in the two-hop swap.  They need to be able to execute trades to manipulate the price of the intermediate token.

Timing: The attacker needs to time their price manipulation to coincide with a user's two-hop swap transaction


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

* Frequency of Two-Hop Swaps: If the contract frequently performs two-hop swaps, the cumulative losses over time can be substantial.

* User's Slippage Tolerance:  While the user sets a slippage tolerance, this is not applied to the first hop.  So, even if a user sets a low slippage tolerance, they are still fully exposed to slippage on the first hop

* Loss of Funds:

* Unfavorable Exchange Rates



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Calculate Expected Output (First Hop): Before performing the first swap, calculate the expected output amount of the intermediate token

Use Minimum Output Amount in First Swap: Pass this calculated minimum output amount as the _amountOutMin parameter to the DEX_ADAPTER.swapV2Single function for the first swap. This will ensure that the first swap only executes if the output amount is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum
