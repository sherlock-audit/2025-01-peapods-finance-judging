# Insufficient Liquidity Minting Denial-of-Service (DoS) Vulnerability

### Summary

The [`addLPAndStake function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/IndexUtils.sol#L82) lacks a check for a minimum liquidity threshold before calling _indexFund.addLiquidityV2. This allows for attempts to add liquidity with insufficient amounts of tokens, potentially leading to a revert due to INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY_MINTED and a Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability.

The [`require(_amountOut > 0, "LPM")`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/IndexUtils.sol#L88) check happens after the addLiquidityV2 call.  If addLiquidityV2 reverts due to insufficient liquidity before it can even return a value, the execution will not reach this line. 

### Root Cause

Absence of a pre-emptive check for a minimum liquidity threshold before attempting to add liquidity to the AMM.

The core problem is that the current code lacks this pre-emptive check. It attempts to add liquidity regardless of whether the amounts of tokens are sufficient to meet the minimum threshold

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Disrupted Reward Compounding

Loss of Potential Yield:  Users are effectively losing out on potential yield.  Because rewards are not being compounded, they are not earning the additional interest or rewards they would have received if the compounding process was functioning correctly



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 implement a minimum liquidity threshold check before attempting to add liquidity to the AMM
