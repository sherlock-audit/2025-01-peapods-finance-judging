# Incorrect Asset Allocation During Debonding Due to Outdated Total Supply in debond() Function

### Summary

The bug lies in  [`function debond`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L139)  of WeightedIndex The key issue is the order of operations.  _percSharesX96 is calculated before _totalSupply is updated.  This means that the _debondAmount calculation uses a withdrawal percentage based on the old (higher) _totalSupply, leading to an over-distribution of assets

```
uint256 _percSharesX96 = (_amountAfterFee * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _totalSupply; // <--- Problem: Uses stale _totalSupply

// ... later ...

_totalSupply -= _amountAfterFee; // _totalSupply is updated *after* the _percSharesX96 calculation

// ... and then in the loop ...

uint256 _debondAmount = (_totalAssets[indexTokens[_i].token] * _percSharesX96) / FixedPoint96.Q96; // <--- Problem: Uses the stale _percSharesX96
```

### Root Cause


The root cause is the use of a stale (outdated) value of _totalSupply when calculating the withdrawal percentage (_percSharesX96).  Specifically, _percSharesX96 is calculated before _totalSupply is updated to reflect the burning of pTKN during the debond operation. This results in an inflated withdrawal percentage, leading to an over-distribution of assets to the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

sufficient pTKN balance for the user to debond, and a non-zero _amount requested for debonding

### External Pre-conditions

* User Interaction: A user must initiate the debond transaction.

* Sufficient Gas: The user must provide enough gas to execute the transaction.

* Valid Parameters: The _amount parameter must be a valid, non-zero amount of pTKN

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The impact of this bug is an over-distribution of assets to users who call the debond function. This dilutes the value of pTKN for the remaining holders, as the total assets are being depleted faster than they should be relative to the circulating supply of pTKN.  Essentially, users are getting slightly more than their fair share of the underlying assets, at the expense of other pTKN holders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

* Recalculate Share Proportions After Burn
*  Update _totalSupply and _totalAssets Before Distribution
*  Ensure Accurate Asset Calculations
