# Gas Limit Issue in Cross-Chain Messaging

### Summary

The [`TokenBridge::_buildMsg function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/ccip/TokenBridge.sol#L76) uses a hardcoded gas limit, retrieved from tokenRouter.targetChainGasLimit(). This inflexibility can lead to several problems:

Transaction Failures: If gas prices on the target chain increase or the complexity of the cross-chain message varies, the hardcoded gas limit might become insufficient, causing transactions to fail.

Gas Waste: If the hardcoded gas limit is unnecessarily high, users will pay for unused gas, leading to unnecessary cost.

Inability to Adapt: The hardcoded gas limit cannot adapt to future network upgrades or changes in gas requirements on the target chain

### Root Cause

_buildMsg function  use of a static/hardcoded gas limit from the  TokenRouter.sol

### Internal Pre-conditions

TokenRouter State
Router Existence: The tokenRouter contract address must be valid and point to a deployed contract
Router Configuration: The tokenRouter's configuration must be appropriate. If using per-chain gas limits, the limits for the relevant chain must be set. If using more complex configurations, those must be correctly configured


_bridgeConf Data:
Valid Configuration: The _bridgeConf (bridge configuration) data passed to _buildMsg must be valid. This usually comes from a lookup in the tokenRouter based on the token and target chain.

 No Invariants Broken:

Contract State: The _buildMsg function itself should not violate any internal invariants of the TokenBridge contract


### External Pre-conditions

User Input Validation:
   Valid Addresses
    Sufficient Balance

Network Conditions
  Network Connectivity

 Token Approval:


 Fees:
Sufficient Native Currency: The user must have enough native currency (e.g., ETH on Ethereum) in their wallet to pay the _nativeFees required for the cross-chain message. 
  



### Attack Path

 Gas Griefing (DoS)


### Impact

 Transaction Failures
 Gas Waste
 Denial-of-Service (DoS) :     the hardcoded gas limit might become insufficient for all transactions

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Using Dynamic Gas Estimation 
  This ivolves  Attempt to estimate the gas required for the cross-chain message before sending it. This often involves simulating the execution on the target chain
