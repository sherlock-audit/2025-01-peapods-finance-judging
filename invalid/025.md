# Lack of Staleness Check in _sequencerCheck() Allows Use of Outdated Sequencer Status

### Summary

The [`_sequencerCheck() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle.sol#L84) in the ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle contract is vulnerable to using outdated sequencer status information.  While the function includes a check for whether the sequencer is up or down and a grace period, it lacks a crucial check for the recency of the data from the _sequencerUptimeFeed.  It  assumes that the data received  is current but does not explicitly check how old the data is.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the vulnerability is the absence of a staleness check on the _sequencerUptimeFeed data within the [`_sequencerCheck() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/oracle/ChainlinkSinglePriceOracle.sol#L84).  The function relies on the _sequencerUptimeFeed to provide the sequencer's status (up or down) and a timestamp. However, it fails to verify if this information is recent.  This allows the oracle to operate based on potentially outdated sequencer status, rendering the intended safety mechanisms (like the grace period) ineffective.  The core issue is the lack of a mechanism to ensure the _sequencerUptimeFeed data reflects the current sequencer state.

```
  uint256 _timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - _startedAt;
if (_timeSinceUp <= SEQ_GRACE_PERIOD) {
    revert GracePeriodNotOver();
}
```
This assumes _startedAt is always fresh, which is not necessarily true.


### Internal Pre-conditions

* The _sequencerUptimeFeed must be properly initialized
*  The latestRoundData() function call must succeed
*  The _startedAt timestamp must be recent
*  The sequencer feed must report reliable answer values
*  Grace period logic must work as expected

### External Pre-conditions

* Chainlink Sequencer Uptime Feed Must Be Functioning Correctly
* The Sequencer Uptime Feed Must Provide Recent Data
*  Time Synchronization Between the Chainlink Oracle and the L2 Network

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

* Transactions Being Rejected Even When the Sequencer Is Up (Denial of Service)
* Loss of Funds Due to Incorrect Grace Period Enforcement
* Incorrect Price Calculations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Add an explicit staleness check within the _sequencerCheck() function.  
This check must verify that the data from the _sequencerUptimeFeed is recent before allowing the oracle to proceed
