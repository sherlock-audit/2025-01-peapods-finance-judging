# Ineffective Slippage Protection in `_processRewardsToPodLp` leading to potential loss of funds

### Summary

The [`_processRewardsToPodLp function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L213), responsible for converting reward tokens to LP tokens, is vulnerable to slippage attacks.  While the called function _tokenToPodLp has a _amountLpOutMin parameter for slippage protection, _processRewardsToPodLp always passes [`0 for this parameter`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L226). This effectively disables the slippage protection, allowing price  manipulation.

### Root Cause

`_processRewardsToPodLp` is   unconditional passed of 0 as the _amountLpOutMin parameter to the [`_tokenToPodLp function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L233C1-L247C6). This effectively disables the slippage protection mechanism that _tokenToPodLp is designed to provide.  Because _amountLpOutMin is always zero, the `require(_lpAmtOut >= _amountLpOutMin, "M")`; check within _tokenToPodLp becomes meaningless, as any output amount (even a tiny, manipulated one) will satisfy the condition.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Reward Tokens must Exist:

yieldConvEnabled is true

_tokenToPodLp's Internal Preconditions:

Price Volatility (or Manipulation

### External Pre-conditions

Price Volatility (or Manipulation):

Malicious Actor 

Knowledge of the Vulnerability:  The attacker (if present) needs to be aware of the vulnerabilityâ€”the fact that _amountLpOutMin is being passed as 0, thus disabling slippage protection.

Timing: The attacker needs to time their price manipulation to coincide with a call to _processRewardsToPodLp (either directly or indirectly through deposit or withdraw).  The closer in time the manipulation is to the vulnerable transaction, the more effective it will be.

##### NOTE
It's important to understand that the vulnerability exists even without a malicious actor. Normal market fluctuations can cause price slippage, and the lack of protection will still lead to losses

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

* Loss of Funds: Users can lose a portion or even a significant amount of their reward token value due to unfavorable price slippage during the conversion to LP tokens

* Reduced LP Token Holdings: Users receive fewer LP tokens than they should have for their reward tokens, diminishing their share of the liquidity pool and potential rewards.
* The fact that it affects core functionality like reward conversion during deposits and withdrawals makes it even more critical

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Pass minLpOut to _tokenToPodLp:  Pass this calculated minLpOut value as the _amountLpOutMin parameter when calling _tokenToPodLp.  This will ensure that the conversion only proceeds if the received amount of LP tokens is greater than or equal to the calculated minimum.

Calculate Expected LP Output: Before calling _tokenToPodLp, calculate the expected amount of LP tokens that should be received in exchange for the reward tokens.
