# Incorrect address of `V3_POS_MGR` on `Base` would break `V3Locker`

### Summary

`V3_POS_MGR` is set to a hardcoded address in the constructor which is incorrect on the `Base` chain, breaking the `V3Locker` contract on that chain.

### Root Cause

```solidity
constructor() Ownable(_msgSender()) {
        CREATED = block.timestamp;
        V3_POS_MGR = INonfungiblePositionManager(0xC36442b4a4522E871399CD717aBDD847Ab11FE88);
    }
```

`0xC36442b4a4522E871399CD717aBDD847Ab11FE88` is the address of the PositionManager on Mainnet, but not on Base

```solidity
//https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments/base-deployments


NonfungiblePositionManager | 0x03a520b32C04BF3bEEf7BEb72E919cf822Ed34f1

```



### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Deploying the contract `V3Locker` would simply revert.

### Impact

`V3Locker` is unusable as it is on `Base`. This is one of the chains mentioned on the contest page, and `Base` supports UniswapV3 Pools.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To make it more flexible and easy to deploy on several chains, simply pass the `address` argument in the constructor
