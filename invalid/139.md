# Potential for Incomplete Leverage Removal Due to block.timestamp Deadline in _unstakeAndRemoveLP

### Summary

The `_unstakeAndRemoveLP function` in  `LeverageManager.sol contract`, used as part of the leverage removal process, utilizes block.timestamp directly as a deadline when interacting with indexUtils.unstakeAndRemoveLP

 the risk is that the flash loan's callback (which calls _unstakeAndRemoveLP) might revert due to network congestion or other issues, preventing the entire leverage removal process from completing.  This can lead to:

Funds Potentially Stuck: The flash loan might be repaid, but the user's collateral might not be properly unstaked and returned, potentially leading to a temporary lock of funds.
Incomplete Operation: The leverage removal would be incomplete, possibly leaving the user's position in an undesirable state.

### Root Cause

[`_unstakeAndRemoveLP`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeverageManager.sol#L562-L564) direct and exclusive reliance on block.timestamp as a deadline within the function,  when calling `indexUtils.unstakeAndRemoveLP`

```
  indexUtils.unstakeAndRemoveLP(
            IDecentralizedIndex(_pod), _spTKNAmtReceived, _podAmtMin, _pairedAssetAmtMin, block.timestamp
        );

```

### Attack Path

### Impact

If the indexUtils.unstakeAndRemoveLP call  fails due to the block.timestamp deadline (because the callback transaction isn't included in the very next block), the leverage removal process will be incomplete. This could leave the user's position in an undesirable state, potentially with collateral still locked or exposed to liquidation risks.


### PoC

### Mitigation

The mitigation for the potential issues related to the block.timestamp deadline in _unstakeAndRemoveLP focuses on making the leverage removal process more robust against temporary network or timing issues.  
The core principle is to allow for a user-specified deadline instead of relying on the current block's timestamp.
