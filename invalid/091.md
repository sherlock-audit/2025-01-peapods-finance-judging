# Missing Bounds Check Allows DoS Attack

### Summary

The `removeIndex function` in the `IndexManager contract` is vulnerable due to a missing bounds check on the _idxInAry input. This allows a malicious authorized user to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by repeatedly calling the function with an out-of-bounds index, preventing legitimate index removals and disrupting the contract's functionality.

### Root Cause

The removeIndex function is vulnerable to  lack of input validation. Specifically, the function does not check if the provided _idxInAry value is within the valid range of the indexes array. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

An authorized user  an account for which authorized[msg.sender] is true
A non-empty indexes array
A non-empty indexes array:

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Denial of Service (DoS)
Operational Disruption



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add a check to ensure that the _idxInAry input is within the valid range of the indexes
```
require(_idxInAry < indexes.length, "Index out of bounds");
