# An attacker can DOS `addLvfSupportForPod` for a given pod

### Summary

Because of the use of `create2`, `addLvfSupportForPod` and `createSelfLendingPodAndAddLvf` can be front ran and allow an attacker to prevent the given pod to have the LVF functionality

### Root Cause

Both `addLvfSupportForPod(` and `createSelfLendingPodAndAddLvf(` trigger the creation of the following oracle

```solidity
_aspTknOracle = IAspTknOracleFactory(aspTknOracleFactory).create(
            _aspTkn, _aspTknOracleRequiredImmutables, _aspTknOracleOptionalImmutables, 0
        );
```

```solidity
function create(address _aspTKN, bytes memory _requiredImmutables, bytes memory _optionalImmutables, uint96 _salt)
        external
        returns (address _oracleAddress)
    {
        _oracleAddress = _deploy(getBytecode(_aspTKN, _requiredImmutables, _optionalImmutables), _getFullSalt(_salt));
        aspTKNMinimalOracle(_oracleAddress).transferOwnership(owner());
        emit Create(_oracleAddress);
    }

...
function _deploy(bytes memory _bytecode, uint256 _finalSalt) internal returns (address _addr) {
        assembly {
            _addr := create2(callvalue(), add(_bytecode, 0x20), mload(_bytecode), _finalSalt)
            if iszero(_addr) { revert(0, 0) }//@audit can be front ran!
        }
    }
```

As you can see, the deployment of the oracle is made using `create2`, i.e is deterministic. This means an attacker can DOS the function by deploying that contract (at ` _addr`) before the call is made.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

An attacker can pre-compute the deployment of the oracle for a given pod(or do it so via front running, copying the parameters passed in `addLvfSupportForPod`), deploying before the call `addLvfSupportForPod`.

### Impact

`addLvfSupportForPod` would simply revert because of the `if iszero(_addr) { revert(0, 0)` line. This means the LVF functionality cannot be added to that given pod, as per the comments in the code:
```solidity
// this effectively is what "turns on" LVF for the pair
        ILeverageManagerAccessControl(leverageManager).setLendingPair(_pod, _fraxlendPair);
```
so leverage is never turned on for that pod, breaking an important functionality.
