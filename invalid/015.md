# Incorrect Asset Allocation in _bond Function Due to Stale Total Asset Values

### Summary

In   WeightedIndex.sol contract ,  the [`_bond function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/WeightedIndex.sol#L139)  _tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96 is calculated before updating _totalAssets to include the current deposit. This causes the token ratio used in the loop to calculate _transferAmt for other tokens to be stale, as it does not account for the updated _totalAssets after the deposit of the first token.

As a result:

The _transferAmt for other tokens in the index is incorrectly calculated.
This leads to an imbalance in asset allocation and incorrect updates to _totalAssets for those tokens.

```
uint256 _tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96 =
    _firstIn ? FixedPoint96.Q96 : (_amount * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _totalAssets[_token];  // <--- Stale _totalAssets used here

// ... later in the loop ...

uint256 _transferAmt = _firstIn
    ? getInitialAmount(_token, _amount, indexTokens[_i].token)
    : (_totalAssets[indexTokens[_i].token] * _tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96) / FixedPoint96.Q96; // <--- Stale ratio used here

_totalAssets[indexTokens[_i].token] += _transferAmt; // <--- Update happens here


```

### Root Cause

The root cause of the bug lies in the calculation of _tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96 before the _totalAssets[_token] is updated to reflect the current deposit.

```
uint256 _tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96 =
    _firstIn ? FixedPoint96.Q96 : (_amount * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _totalAssets[_token];
```


* The variable _tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96 is derived using _totalAssets[_token] without including the current deposit amount (_amount).
* Since _totalAssets[_token] remains stale at this point, the ratio does not accurately reflect the updated total assets, leading to an incorrect ratio being propagated throughout the loop

### Internal Pre-conditions

Internal Pre-conditions (
* Token Exists in Index: _token must be valid (_isTokenInIndex[_token] == true).
* Not First Deposit: _firstIn must be false to trigger stale _totalAssets[_token].
* Stale _totalAssets: _totalAssets[_token] is used before being updated with the new _amount.
* Token Loop Runs: indexTokens.length > 0 ensures the loop executes.
* No Recalculation: _tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96 is not recomputed inside the loop.

### External Pre-conditions

External Pre-conditions 
* User Deposit: The user must call the bond function with a valid token and amount, which will trigger the asset allocation.
* Correct Amount Minted: The calculated _tokensMinted must meet the minimum required (_tokensMinted - _feeTokens >= _amountMintMin).
* Fee Conditions: Fees must be properly checked for the user to avoid improper burning of tokens.
* Valid Token: The _token parameter must be recognized as a valid token in the protocol (i.e., _isTokenInIndex[_token] == true).
* Contract State: The protocol must have valid values for _totalAssets, _totalSupply, and other internal states before the bond action is performed.
These conditions affect the protocol's behavior during the deposit and distribution process and trigger the bug when ignored.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The bug causes an imbalance in the token weights within the index. Due to the stale calculation of _tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96, the amounts of tokens transferred into the contract are calculated incorrectly. This results in these tokens being proportionally smaller than intended, disrupting the correct weighting. This could lead to disadvantages for users, especially during debonding or any other operations that rely on the correct index balance. If token weights are inaccurate, users might receive less than their fair share during asset distribution, affecting their overall returns or stake in the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

the calculation of _tokenAmtSupplyRatioX96 must be performed within the loop, immediately before the calculation of _transferAmt for each token. This ensures that the ratio uses the most up-to-date value of _totalAssets[_token], reflecting the current deposit.
