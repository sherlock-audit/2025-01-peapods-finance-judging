# Lack of Access Control on TokenRouter.getConfig

### Summary

The [`getConfig`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/ccip/TokenRouter.sol#L16) in  TokenRoute is publicly accessible, anyone can read the bridge configuration, including sensitive information like the targetBridge address, prematurely

### Root Cause

The TokenRouter's getConfig function is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to read the bridge configuration (including the sensitive targetBridge address), potentially leading to information leakage and minor griefing.  The root cause is the lack of access control on this function.


### Impact

The impact of the publicly accessible getConfig function in TokenRouter is primarily information leakage, potentially aiding attackers, and secondarily, minor griefing.  While not directly enabling theft, premature exposure of sensitive data like the targetBridge address can give attackers an advantage. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Implement role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl contract. or  a  CONFIG_VIEWER_ROLE" should be created, and only authorized accounts should be granted this role, allowing them to call  getConfig function
