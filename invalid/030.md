# Unbounded Allowance Vulnerability

### Summary

The contracts (`CamelotDexAdapter` and `UniswapDexAdapter`) use `safeIncreaseAllowance` but never revoke allowances granted to routers (`V2_ROUTER`, `V3_ROUTER`). This creates an unbounded allowance risk, potentially exposing user funds to exploitation if the router contracts are compromised.

### Impact

* Unlimited Spending Permission: The core issue is that the contract grants an allowance to the router contract (either V2_ROUTER or V3_ROUTER), but this allowance is never revoked.  This means that the router (or, more accurately, whoever controls the router) has permission to spend up to the approved amount of the user's tokens indefinitely.

* Router Compromise:  While the router contracts are generally considered trustworthy, there's always a risk of a vulnerability being discovered in the router contract itself, or the private keys controlling the router being compromised.

* If the router contract is compromised, an attacker could exploit the existing unrevoked allowances to drain all the tokens that users have approved to the router through these adapter contracts.  This could affect a large number of users and result in a substantial loss of funds.

* No Time Limit:  The vulnerability exists indefinitely.  Even if a user interacts with the CamelotDexAdapter or UniswapDexAdapter once and never uses it again, the allowance remains active.  The user's funds are at risk until they manually revoke the allowance (if they are even aware of the risk).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Revoke After Interaction: Revoke the allowance immediately after the interaction with the router is finished.  This should be done within the same transaction if possible.  this is done by using  OpenZeppelin's safeDecreaseAllowance   to decrease the allowance
