# _processRewardsToPodLp Gas Griefing: Unbounded _allRewardsTokens Allows DoS

### Summary

A gas griefing vulnerability exists in the interaction between the [`_processRewardsToPodLp function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L213C1-L231C6)  and the ITokenRewards contract's `getAllRewardsTokens()` function.  Because `_processRewardsToPodLp` iterates over all tokens in the `_allRewardsTokens` array, even irrelevant , an attacker (or malicious admin) can inflate the size of this array. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, as the gas cost of calling `_processRewardsToPodLp` becomes prohibitively high, preventing legitimate users from using related functions like deposit and withdraw.  The vulnerability lies in the TokenRewards contract's control over the `_allRewardsTokens` array, which the IndexUtils contract cannot influence.

### Root Cause

 The unbounded nature of the `_allRewardsTokens` array in the TokenRewards contract, combined with the fact that _processRewardsToPodLp iterates over this entire array, regardless of the relevance or validity of the tokens within it.  Specifically, the getAllRewardsTokens() function in TokenRward contract simply returns the _allRewardsTokens array without any size restrictions or filtering, allowing an external actor (potentially malicious) to inflate its size arbitrarily.  This, in turn, forces the _processRewardsToPodLp function to perform a large number of unnecessary iterations, leading to excessive gas consumption and potential denial-of-service, thereby affecting the withdraw , redeem and deposit functions which calls it.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_allRewardsTokens   get populated:
_processRewardsToPodLp is Called:  A transaction must call a function that, in turn, calls _processRewardsToPodLp

### External Pre-conditions

Control over _allRewardsTokens
Knowledge of the Vulnerability
Timing (For Maximum Impact):  While not strictly required, the attacker can maximize the impact of their attack by timing it to coincide with periods of high activity on the protocol. This will amplify the denial-of-service effect, as more legitimate users will be affected.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Increased Gas Costs for Legitimate Users

Denial-of-Service (DoS):  A large-scale attack, where the attacker adds a massive number of tokens to _allRewardsTokens, can make the gas cost of calling _processRewardsToPodLp prohibitively high.  This effectively prevents legitimate users from using the affected functions, causing a DoS

Interruption of Core Functionality: If the affected functions (like deposit and withdraw) are crucial for the protocol's operation, the DoS can severely disrupt the protocol's functionality. Users may be unable to deposit funds, withdraw their assets, or claim rewards



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


separate the list of all reward tokens from the list of active reward tokens and have _processRewardsToPodLp iterate over the active list
