# Inadequate Liquidation Incentives for Small Debt Positions

### Summary

The [`FraxlendPairCore.sol::liquidation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L1135-L1153) mechanism/logic lacks adequate incentives for liquidating small debt positions. The liquidation fee structure applies a fixed percentage (cleanLiquidationFee or dirtyLiquidationFee) to all positions regardless of their size. This means that for very small debts, the absolute amount of additional collateral awarded to liquidators might not cover the transaction costs (gas fees) or provide sufficient motivation to undertake the liquidation process

### Root Cause

fixed percentage application of liquidation fees (cleanLiquidationFee and dirtyLiquidationFee) without considering the position size

### Internal Pre-conditions

_addInterest();
This ensures that all interest is calculated before liquidation,

(, uint256 _exchangeRate,) = _updateExchangeRate();
 ensure the current collateral-to-asset ratio is used for liquidation calculations.

Liquidation Fee Calculation:
`_optimisticCollateralForLiquidator = (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + cleanLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;`
`_collateralForLiquidator = (_liquidationAmountInCollateralUnits * (LIQ_PRECISION + dirtyLiquidationFee)) / LIQ_PRECISION;`
Here, the fees are calculated. These fees are applied uniformly, not accounting for the size of the position, which leads to the lack of incentive for small liquidations

Protocol Fee Calculation:

```
if (protocolLiquidationFee > 0) {
    _feesAmount = (protocolLiquidationFee * _collateralForLiquidator) / LIQ_PRECISION;
    _collateralForLiquidator = _collateralForLiquidator - _feesAmount;
}
```
This further reduces the incentive for liquidators, especially for small positions, as part of the collateral they would receive is taken as a fee for the protocol

### External Pre-conditions

Gas Costs:
High Transaction Fees

Market Liquidity:
Asset Liquidity: The liquidity of the asset being liquidated can influence the incentive



### Attack Path

Attack Path: Creating Unliquidatable Debt
   * Position Creation:  user opens many small borrow positions, each just below the threshold where liquidation becomes unprofitable due to high gas costs relative to the reward. This could be done by
  Borrowing a small amount of asset tokens with just enough collateral to avoid immediate liquidation

### Impact

Accumulation of Bad Debt:
Decreased Asset Utilization
Further Attacks:
Once user/ attacker  finds one vulnerability, they might explore others, potentially leading to more sophisticated attacks or combined exploits

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Dynamic Liquidation Fees
  Implement a fee structure/ incentive where the percentage increases for smaller positions
