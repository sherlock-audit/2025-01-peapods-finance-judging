# Division by Zero Vulnerability in _depositRewards Function When totalShares Becomes Zero

### Summary

The core issue is a potential division by zero error in the [`_depositRewards function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L232),  in [`TokenReward.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L206) leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability
The function calculates rewards per share with this line:
```
 _rewardsPerShare[_token] += (PRECISION * _depositAmount) / totalShares;
```
if totalShares is 0, this causes a division by zero, reverting the transaction

#### Insufficient Existing Check:
##### The existing check:
```solidity
if (totalShares == 0) {
    require(_token == rewardsToken, "R");
    _burnRewards(_amountTotal);
    return;
}
```
the above code only handles the case where totalShares is 0 at the beginning of the function call and only if the deposited token is the main rewardsToken

##### Vulnerability (DoS):
An attacker can cause totalShares to become 0 after some rewards have been deposited for other tokens. This is done by users removing all their shares. Then, any subsequent deposit for that other token will trigger the division by zero, blocking further deposits for that token and others.  



### Root Cause

* Incomplete Handling of Zero totalShares: 
    The code attempts to handle the case where totalShares is zero with the following block:
```
if (totalShares == 0) {
    require(_token == rewardsToken, "R");
    _burnRewards(_amountTotal);
    return;
}
```

The root cause of the division by zero vulnerability is an insufficient check on the totalShares variable within the _depositRewards function.


Dependency on totalShares: The reward distribution logic relies on dividing by totalShares to calculate the reward per share. This creates a direct dependency on totalShares being a non-zero value.

Incomplete Handling of Zero totalShares: The code attempts to handle the case where totalShares is zero with the following block:

```
if (totalShares == 0) {
    require(_token == rewardsToken, "R");
    _burnRewards(_amountTotal);
    return;
}
```
In simpler terms:

The code assumes that if totalShares is not zero at the start of the function, it will remain non-zero throughout the function's execution. This assumption is incorrect. Users can withdraw all their staked tokens, causing totalShares to become zero after the initial check but before the division.

the root cause is the failure to account for the dynamic nature of totalShares and the lack of a check immediately prior to the division operation. The existing check only handles a specific initial condition (only if the deposited token is the main rewardsToken) and is insufficient to prevent the division by zero error in all cases



### Internal Pre-conditions

The code checks totalShares == 0 at the beginning of the function and only handles the case where the deposited token is rewardsToken.

What the code should check: The code should ensure totalShares > 0 immediately before the line:

```
_rewardsPerShare[_token] += (PRECISION * _depositAmount) / totalShares;
```
The vulnerability arises because totalShares can change during the execution of the _depositRewards function due to external calls (user unstaking). Therefore, the initial check is insufficient. The missing pre-condition check right before the division is the root of the problem.

### External Pre-conditions

* Users initially stake tokens: This sets totalShares to a value greater than 0.
* Rewards are deposited (potentially for a non-rewardsToken): This establishes a non-zero _rewardsPerShare value for that token.
* All users withdraw their staked tokens: This causes totalShares to become 0.
* A subsequent deposit is attempted (for the same non-rewardsToken): This triggers the _depositRewards function again, but now totalShares is 0, leading to the division by zero error.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

* Denial of service (DoS) for reward distribution.
* Potential orphaned or stuck funds, making rewards inaccessible.
*  The severity of this vulnerability is high because it can completely halt a core function of the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add a require statement immediately before the division operation that uses totalShares. require statement checks if totalShares is greater than 0. If it's not, the transaction reverts, preventing the division by zero error.

```
+        require(totalShares > 0, "Division by zero");   //  added Mitigation
         _rewardsPerShare[_token] += (PRECISION * _depositAmount) / totalShares;
         emit DepositRewards(_msgSender(), _token, _depositAmount);
```


Let's say an attacker has manipulated totalShares to become 0. When the _depositRewards function is called and reaches the mitigated code:

The require(totalShares > 0, "Division by zero"); line is executed.
Since totalShares is 0, the condition totalShares > 0 is false.
The require statement causes the transaction to revert with the error message "Division by zero".
The division operation is never executed, preventing the error and the DoS.
