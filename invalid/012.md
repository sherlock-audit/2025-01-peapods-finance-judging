# Incorrect Transfer Amount Calculation Due to Reliance on Balance Check

### Summary

The function [`_depositRewardsFromToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L189C1-L189C5) calculates the actual transfer amount based on the difference between the contract's token balance before and after a transfer. This method is unreliable because external transactions or reentrant calls can alter the balance, leading to incorrect calculations. This can result in overcharging or undercharging fees, depositing the wrong reward amount

### Root Cause

[`_depositRewardsFromToken function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/TokenRewards.sol#L189) in TokenReward.sol lies in the reliance on the contract's token balance to calculate the amount transferred. 

```solidity
uint256 _balBefore = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(_user, address(this), _finalAmt);
_finalAmt = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this)) - _balBefore;

```

* This assumes that the only change in the contract's balance comes from the transfer initiated by safeTransferFrom

##### External Balance Changes:

* The contract's balance may be affected by other external transactions or reentrant calls during the execution of the function. These changes can occur:
If another user or contract sends tokens to the contract during this time.

##### Unreliable Calculation:

As a result, _finalAmt is not guaranteed to accurately reflect the tokens transferred by _user. Instead, it may include:
Tokens added to the contract by external sources (leading to overcharging).
Tokens removed from the contract by external actions (leading to undercharging).


* The function assumes that the contract's token balance will only change due to the safeTransferFrom call. This assumption fails in a real-world, high-concurrency environment where other transaction can modify the contract's balance, leading to incorrect calculations of _finalAmt.

### Internal Pre-conditions

###### Internal Pre-conditions 
No Concurrent Balance Changes: The contract's token balance must remain unchanged by external actions during execution.
Compliant ERC20 Token: _token must follow the ERC20 standard without reentrancy issues.
Valid Parameters: _amount > 0 and _token must pass _isValidRewardsToken.
Sufficient Allowance and Balance: _user must have enough allowance and tokens for the transfer.
Accurate Admin Fee Logic: Fee calculation must not cause inconsistencies in _finalAmt.

### External Pre-conditions

##### External Pre-conditions (Brief):
No external token transfers should occur during execution.
The token (_token) must follow ERC20 standards without reentrancy.
_user must have sufficient balance and allowance for the transfer.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

###### Overcharging: 
    *  Inflated _finalAmt leads to excessive  fees, diverting extra funds .
    
##### Reward Misallocation: 
    *  Incorrect _finalAmt results in an inaccurate deposit of rewards, disrupting the reward system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
```solidity
 if (_shouldTransfer) {
        IERC20(_token).safeTransferFrom(_user, address(this), _amount);
        _finalAmt = _amount; // Mitigation: Use the original _amount
    }
```
By directly assigning _finalAmt = _amount after the safeTransferFrom call, the contract now correctly uses the intended transfer amount. This eliminates the race condition because the calculation no longer depends on potentially changing balances.
