# "Incorrect Redemption Logic in redeemFromVault Can Lead to Fund Mismanagement and Potential Loss"

### Summary

The [`redeemFromVault function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/LendingAssetVault.sol#L325C3-L334C6) in LendingAssetVault.sol contract  contains a flawed redemption logic that can lead to incorrect asset tracking and potential fund mismanagement. Specifically:

The _redeemAmt calculation
```
  uint256 _redeemAmt = vaultUtilization[_vault] < _amountAssets ? vaultUtilization[_vault] : _amountAssets;
 ```
incorrectly limits the redeemable amount based on vaultUtilization[_vault], which tracks borrowed assets rather than actual holdings. This could prevent rightful redemptions or cause inconsistencies in accounting.

The function also attempts to prevent underflow using:

```
vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _redeemAmt > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultDeposits[_vault] : _redeemAmt;
```
This logic is incorrect because vaultDeposits should not be reduced when redeeming shares—it tracks deposits, not withdrawals.
Due to these errors, the vault’s internal accounting may become desynchronized, leading to incorrect asset allocation, potential loss of funds, or unintended restrictions on redemptions.

### Root Cause

Misinterpretation of vaultUtilization in _redeemAmt Calculation:
 ```
 uint256 _redeemAmt = vaultUtilization[_vault] < _amountAssets ? vaultUtilization[_vault] : _amountAssets;
```
This  limits _redeemAmt based on vaultUtilization[_vault], which represents borrowed assets rather than the actual redeemable balance, this causes incorrect redemption limits and can restrict rightful withdrawals

The line
```
vaultDeposits[_vault] -= _redeemAmt > vaultDeposits[_vault] ? vaultDeposits[_vault]
```
vaultDeposits should not be decreased upon redemption, as it tracks total deposited assets.


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect Fund Accounting
Potential Funds Loss or Lockup
Excessive Asset Deduction from vaultDeposits:
     Since vaultDeposits[_vault] is being reduced incorrectly, the vault might reflect lower deposits than reality, preventing users from accessing their rightful funds.

### Mitigation

A complete  overhual of the logic  and remove the incorrect limitation
