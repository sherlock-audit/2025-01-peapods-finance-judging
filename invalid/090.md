# Double Counting of Fee in _totalSupply

### Summary

The [`FlashMintfunction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/DecentralizedIndex.sol#L424) in the   `DecentralizedInde.sol `  it  incorrectly reduces the _totalSupply by the fee amount twice.  The full amount (which includes the fee) is already burned and its effect on _totalSupply accounted for in the _burn call.  The subsequent line ` _totalSupply -= _fee == 0 ? 1 : _fee` causes a redundant reduction, leading to an  an incorrect _totalSupply.  This can have significant consequences for other parts of the contract that rely on _totalSupply

### Root Cause

The line `_totalSupply -= _fee == 0 ? 1 : _fee;` attempts to adjust _totalSupply after the _burn function has already accounted for the burning of the full amount (including the fee). This leads to a double-counting of the fee's impact on _totalSupply, resulting an incorrect total supply.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

##### Incorrect Accounting:  
  The contract's internal accounting of the total token supply (_totalSupply) will be incorrect. This can lead to:
   incorrect  Distribution    
  Flawed Percentage Calculations



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the problematic line:

```solidity
_totalSupply -= _fee == 0 ? 1 : _fee;
