# Front-Running Vulnerability in TokenRouter.setConfig Allows Stealing Bridged Tokens

### Summary

The [`TokenRouter contract`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/ccip/TokenRouter.sol) exhibits a critical front-running vulnerability in its [`setConfig function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/ccip/TokenRouter.sol#L25). This function, responsible for setting the crucial targetBridge address for token bridging, is externally callable.  This allows malicious actors to observe a legitimate setConfig transaction in the mempool and front-run it with their own transaction, setting the targetBridge to an address they control. 

### Root Cause

Externally Callable setConfig: The setConfig function, which sets the critical targetBridge address, is externally callable. This means that anyone can submit a transaction to call this function.

Transaction Visibility in Mempool: Transactions waiting to be included in a block are visible in the mempool.  This allows malicious actors to observe pending setConfig transactions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

TokenRouter Deployed: The TokenRouter contract must be deployed and functional.

Owner Exists: An account with ownership privileges for the TokenRouter contract exists.

Intended Configuration: The owner has determined the correct values for the TokenConfig struct, including the proper targetBridge address, _targetChain, _sourceToken, _sourceTokenMintBurn, and _targetToken.

Gas Available: The owner has sufficient ETH in their wallet to pay for the gas costs of the setConfig transaction.

No Prior Malicious Configuration:  The _configs mapping within the TokenRouter must not already contain a malicious configuration for the specific _sourceToken and _targetChain combination that the owner intends to configure.  If a malicious configuration is already in place, the front-running attack might not be necessary.

No Concurrent Configuration: No other party is simultaneously attempting to configure the same _sourceToken and _targetChain combination.  If multiple parties are trying to configure at the same time, the outcome could be unpredictable.

Mempool Visibility: The owner's transaction calling setConfig is visible in the mempool before it is included in a block. This visibility is a crucial precondition for the front-running attack.  Without it, the attacker wouldn't know to front-run the transaction.

### External Pre-conditions

Attacker Exists: A malicious actor with an Ethereum wallet and sufficient ETH to pay for gas exists.

Attacker's Observation: The attacker is actively monitoring the mempool and observes the owner's pending setConfig transaction.

Attacker's Gas: The attacker has enough ETH in their wallet to outbid the owner's gas price and ensure their malicious transaction is included in a block before the owner's.
