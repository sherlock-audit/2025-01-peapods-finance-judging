# Improper handling of totalAssets when LendingAssetVault::redeemFromVault is called

### Summary

When LAV.redeemFromVault() is called, it triggers FraxlendPair.redeem(), which returns the assets received from the vault.

These assets are subtracted from the vaultUtilization (a variable tracking the assets utilized in the vault).

The current system correctly updates the vault utilization parameters due to the issue highlighted in M-22 of the guardian audit

However, the system fails to account for excess assets (e.g., due to dust accrual or direct share transfer donations) in the totalAssets variable. This locks the excess value in the LAV contract permanently.



### Root Cause

The totalAssets variable is not updated to include the excess tokens received during the redemption process. This discrepancy occurs because the system only subtracts the redeemed assets from vaultUtilization but does not add the excess to totalAssets.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The totalAssetsUtilized for the vault does not match the actual asset value of the shares owned by the LAV in the vault.


### External Pre-conditions
Party donates shares to the vault by transfer 


### Attack Path

The owner calls redeemFromVault with the entire vault share balance of the LAV.

All assets belonging to the LAV are sent to the vault.

The excess assets (due to dust accrual or donations) are not added to totalAssets, leaving them permanently locked in the contract.

### Impact

permanent loss of excess assets that could otherwise be utilized by the contract or its users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix the issue, the following line of code should be added to the redeemFromVault function, just after redeemAmt is calculated but before vaultUtilization is updated:

```solidity
totalAssets += amountAssets > vaultUtilization[_vault] ? amountAssets - vaultUtilization[_vault] : 0;
```
