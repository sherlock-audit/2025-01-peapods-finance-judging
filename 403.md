# When minting, we provide the number `1` as a static id, which will cause to mint and have only one leverage position in the whole protocol lifecycle

### Summary

When we want to create a leveraged position, we mint an erc721 standard nft providing the number of 1 as a static id, instead of the `tokenId` itself.

This is disastrous and will cause only one NFT to be minted for the whole app, thus destroying the integrity and purpose of it.

The function that I am talking about is [LeveragePositions::mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/lvf/LeveragePositions.sol#L14-L18) and this part of it -> `_mint(_receiver, 1)`

### Root Cause

The root cause is that in `_mint(_receiver, 1);` we provide the second parameter as the static number of `1` instead of the `tokenId`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice wants to create the first leveraged position and does that successfully via `initializePosition()` or `_addLeverageCallback()`
2. Bob wants to create the second leveraged position, but the tx will revert because there can't be two nfts with the same id of one, thus rendering the application useless

### Impact

The impact is that only one leverage position can exist thorough the whole protocol's lifecycle, which is surely not intended.

Broken functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the second param with the `tokenId`, which is a numerical variable that's incrementing on every `mint()`, thus ensuring that every single nft will have a unique `tokenId`
