# Utilization rate change can be sandwiched in lending vault for profit

### Summary

Utilization rate change can be sandwiched in lending vault for profit

### Root Cause

In [FraxlendPairCore contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/fraxlend/src/contracts/FraxlendPairCore.sol#L313C1-L316C12), `addInterest` function only updates the interest when the specific utilization rate exceeds. 

```solidity
        if (
            _currentUtilizationRate != 0 
                && _rateChange < _currentUtilizationRate * minURChangeForExternalAddInterest / UTIL_PREC 
        ) {
            emit SkipAddingInterest(_rateChange);
        } else {
            (, _interestEarned, _feesAmount, _feesShare, _currentRateInfo) = _addInterest(); 
        }
```

This is a design choice by protocol in order to save gas but it's unacceptable because it will give opportunity for attackers to make profit from this situation and this profit will cause loss of funds for the other users in the pool. 

Simply, attacker needs to track the interest accruals and utilization changes in time period and whenever it reachs to borderline point, he can deposit assets to vault and then he can withdraw back his assets because the utilization rate will exceed the threshold to trigger interest accrual and the attacker will directly make a profit from this action.



### Internal Pre-conditions

No conditions needed

### External Pre-conditions

No conditions needed

### Attack Path

1. Attacker tracks the lending pair's state
2. Whenever utilization rate change becomes closer to threshold, he will deposit to lending vault
3. In the next block `addInterest` function will trigger interest accrual and attacker can make profit by withdrawing back the shares

### Impact

Actually, attacker gets share from a cheap price at the first action. Because normally, interest accrual should be simulated and then reftected to the lending vault in order to generate a correct result. But instead, it only updates the interest value at specific utilization change points.

Attacker can directly make profit from this attack vector and it will create unfair share distribution for the lending vault. In order to give an example of impact, let say an user depositted to lending vault in order to get some interest from lending pair. Let say  interest accrual can trigger utilization rate change threshold after 1 hour later. It means this user can get his interest after minimum 1 hour later. But attacker can directly get the same interest profit by just depositting just before interest accrual.


### Mitigation

Update the interest no matter utilization rate change
