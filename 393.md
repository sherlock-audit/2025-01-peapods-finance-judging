# Setting the `block.timestamp` as a deadline is dangerous

### Summary

In several places, such as `AutoCompoundingPodLP::deposit()` the deadline chosen to revert the transaction is any `block.timestamp` after the timestamp the transaction was initiated. 

This presents a very likely scenario in which periods when network congestion will occur, making it unlikely to execute the tx in the same block it is initiated, thus DoS-ing the protocol in such critical functions

### Root Cause

Setting the deadline as just the `block.timestamp` is an easy way of making your tx revert when there's just little network congestion.

Ideally, it should be `block.timestamp` + 3 minutes or something like that to have it as a deadline, because it will be highly likely that the tx will NOT execute in the same block it was initiated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Transaction needs to execute at a different block it was initiated

### External Pre-conditions

There should be some network congestion to cause the revert

### Attack Path

1.  When price are changing fast, there will be a lot of network congestion, so Bob decides to remove the leverage he has, which will start from `LeverageManager::removeLeverage` going into `DecentralizedIndex::flash()`, then `LeverageManager::callback()` -> `LeverageManager::_removeLeveragePostCallback()` and finally `LeverageManager::_unstakeAndRemoveLP()` that calls `indexUtils.unstakeAndRemoveLP()` with `block.timestamp` as a deadline
2. Transaction is executed 2 blocks later, which will result in a different `block.timestamp`, thus reverting
3. Prices drop even more so Bob is forced to take an even bigger loss if he wants to again initiate removing leverage 

### Impact

There is possible loss of money due to time sensitive operations due to the DoS, as well as the DoS itself stopping the user from calling certain functions in periods of network congestion.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set the deadline as the `block.timestamp` plus a small arbitraty time like 2 to 3 minutes.
