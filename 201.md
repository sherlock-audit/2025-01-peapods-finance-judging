# Pods DoS if V3TwapUtilities owner renounces ownership

### Summary

If the owner of `V3TwapUtilities` renounces ownership, it causes `TokenRewards` to revert during the processing of the admin fee. This results in a DoS for Pods, disrupting reward distribution and affecting nearly all essential operations, including debonding, transfers, and providing liquidity.

### Root Cause

 The `TokenRewards::_processAdminFee` function does not check that the receiver is not the zero address.
```solidity
function _processAdminFee(uint256 _amount) internal {
    IERC20(PAIRED_LP_TOKEN).safeTransfer(OwnableUpgradeable(address(V3_TWAP_UTILS)).owner(), _amount);
}
```

Some ERC20 implementations (including PEAS and Pods) revert if a transfer is made to the zero address, and the `SafeERC20` library does not protect against this.

`V3TwapUtilities` uses OpenZeppelin’s `Ownable` implementation, which includes a `renounceOwnership` function.

As a result, if the `V3TwapUtilities` owner is not set, the transaction will revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `V3TwapUtilities` owner is set to the zero address.
- The rewards token implementation reverts on transfers to the zero address.


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

The owner of `V3TwapUtilities` renounces ownership.

### Impact

This issue causes a DoS for all Pods that use reward token implementations which revert on transfers to the zero address. Even if there’s no intention to renounce ownership at the moment, it introduces a significant centralization risk (especially for the protocol that claims to be decentralized and permissionless by design), turning the `V3TwapUtilities` contract owner into a single point of failure that could bring down a large portion of Pods.

### PoC

OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 implementation reverts on transfers to the zero address:

An example of a Pod that uses the PEAS token (which utilizes OpenZeppelin ERC20) as a reward token:

### Mitigation

Remove the ability to renounce ownership of `V3TwapUtilities` or verify that the owner is set before transferring fees.
