# Incorrect value returned from `maxWithdraw` in `AutoCompoundingPodLp` contract

### Summary

The `maxWithdraw` function should return the amount of assets that can be withdrawn by the user, but it does not consider the rewards that are accrued to the user, thus returning incorrect value.

### Root Cause

The [`maxWithdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/d28eb19f4b39d3db7997477460f9f9c76839cb0c/contracts/contracts/AutoCompoundingPodLp.sol#L154-L156) function does not consider the rewards that are accrued to the user.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- One of the rewards is accrued to `TokenRewards` contract

### External Pre-conditions

- A user tries to withdraw maximum amounts of assets she can withdraw by using `maxWithdraw` function

### Attack Path

- Alice has 100 `aspTkn` out of 1000 `aspTkn` as total supply, which represents 1100 `spTkn` as total assets
- 1000 DAI of rewards has been accrued to `TokenRewards` contract, which is equal to 100 `spTkn`, for example
- Alice tries to withdraw maximum amounts of assets she can withdraw by using `maxWithdraw` function
- `maxWithdraw` does not consider rewards, thus return 110
- But it should return 120

### Impact

- Users can have incorrect information about their assets leading to withdrawing wrong amount of assets
- ERC4626 incompatibility that causes potential integration issues

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `maxWithdraw` function should simulate the reward accrual and swapping them into `spTkn` to calculate the correct amount of total assets under management.
