# Attacker can set malicious `_overrideLendingPair` can drain funds in LeverageManager.


### Summary

Attacker can set malicious `_overrideLendingPair` can drain funds in LeverageManager.

### Root Cause

When creating a position in LeverageManager, user can set `_overrideLendingPair` to any address. This is assumed to be the fraxlending pair address, however, attacker can set this to a malicious contract and drain funds in LeverageManager.

In removeLeverage, attacker can define whichever asset he wants to drain in the `asset()` function of the malicious contract. Then, a `safeIncreaseAllowance` is called to the malicious contract for this token. The attack only needs to pay an extra flashloan fee.

For example, if there were 100 USDC leftover in the contract. The attacker can set `borrowAssetAmt` to 100. The removeLeverage would still conduct the flashloan for 100 USDC, and the attacker has to pay 100 USDC + fees. But in return, the attack gains the original 100 USDC which was originally in LeverageManager contract.

As for why there may be remaining tokens in the contract, it is a separate bug reported in another issue, which is also related to removeLeverage. In the `_removeLeveragePostCallback()` function, if there is leftover borrowedTKN after the pTKN -> borrowedTKN swap, it is not returned to the user. This can be later drained by attackers.

```


### Internal pre-conditions

- LeverageManager has stuck tokens within. This token should also have a flashSource, so it can trigger the removeLeverage feature.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Explained above.

### Impact

Loss of funds for admin, considering there is a admin-function to rescue funds.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Always use admin-set value for lending pairs.
