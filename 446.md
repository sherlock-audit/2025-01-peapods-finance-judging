# LeverageManager remove leverage will lead to stuck tokens if slippage `_podSwapAmtOutMin` is set.


### Summary

LeverageManager remove leverage will lead to stuck tokens if slippage `_podSwapAmtOutMin` is set.

### Root Cause

First we need to understand the workflow of removeLeverage in LeverageManager.

1. Borrow `_borrowAssetAmt` underlying token from flashloan source.
2. Repay these tokens to FraxlendPair.
3. Withdraw collateral (aspTKN) to borrowedTKN and pTKN. If borrowedTKN is not enough to repay the flashloan, swap pTKN to borrowedTKN.
4. Repay flashloan.
5. Send leftover borrowedTKN and pTKN back to position owner.

In step 3, it conducts an exactOutput swap. The target amount of output is the required amount of borrowedTKN for repay. However, this is susceptible to frontrunning and sandwich attacks. So the user needs to explicitly set a `_podSwapAmtOutMin` parameter as slippage.

The issue here is, if `_podSwapAmtOutMin` is set, and there are leftover borrowTKNs, they are not transferred to the user, but stuck in the contract. This is because `_borrowAmtRemaining` will always be zero in this case.

For example, after redeeming the spTKN, we have 100 pTKN and 100 borrowedTKN (pTKN:borrowedTKN = 1:1). However, we need to repay 120 borrowedTKN. If user don't set `_podSwapAmtOutMin`, the pTKN -> borrowedTKN swap would be a maxInput=100, exactOutput=20 swap, which can obviously be sandwiched. If user sets `_podSwapAmtOutMin` to 95 for slippage, the remaining 95-20=75 borrowedTokens are not transferred back to user.

        uint256 _repayAmount = _d.amount + _d.fee;
        if (_pairedAmtReceived < _repayAmount) {
            _podAmtRemaining = _acquireBorrowTokenForRepayment(
                _props,
                _posProps.pod,
                _d.token,
                _repayAmount - _pairedAmtReceived,
                _podAmtReceived,

    }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

- When removing leverage, a pTKN -> borrowTKN swap is required, and user sets `_podSwapAmtOutMin` for slippage.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Leftover borrowedTokens are locked in the contract.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Also transfer the remaining borrowTKN to user.
