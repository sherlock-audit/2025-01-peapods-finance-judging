# If a reward is paused in the whitelist, all users who interact with the staking pool will forever lose claim to that paused reward and the reward is locked in the contract  even when unpaused

### Summary

The setShares function in the tracking token contract is designed to distribute rewards, update shares, and reset exclusions for users. However, when a reward token is paused, the contract fails to distribute rewards but still updates the user's exclusion state. This results in the following issues:

Paused Rewards Locked Forever: If a reward token is paused, users cannot claim their accrued rewards, and their exclusion state is updated, preventing them from ever claiming these rewards, even after the token is unpaused.

Unclaimable New Rewards: Paused tokens can still be deposited as rewards, further exacerbating the issue by adding more unclaimable rewards to the contract.

Forced Interaction Exploit: A malicious user can transfer a negligible amount (e.g., 1 wei) of the tracking token to another user, triggering setShares and locking their paused rewards permanently.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the incorrect handling of paused reward tokens in the _distributeReward and _resetExcluded functions:

_distributeReward: If a reward token is paused, the function skips distributing rewards but does not store the unclaimed amount for future distribution.

_resetExcluded: The function updates the user's exclusion state for all reward tokens, including paused ones, even though no rewards were distributed.

This combination ensures that paused rewards are permanently locked in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A reward token is paused by the protocol.

A user has accrued rewards in the paused token.


### External Pre-conditions

A user interacts with the tracking token contract (e.g., by receiving a transfer of the tracking token).

### Attack Path

Deploy the tracking token contract and configure a reward token (e.g., USDC).

Accrue 1,000 USDC in rewards for Bob.

Pause USDC rewards.

Alice sends 1 wei of the tracking token to Bob, triggering setShares.

Observe that:

Bob's 1,000 USDC rewards are not distributed.

Bob's exclusion state is updated, preventing him from claiming the rewards in the future.

### Impact

Permanent Loss of Rewards: Users lose access to their accrued rewards in paused tokens, even after the tokens are unpaused.

Locked Funds: Paused rewards cannot be reclaimed or redistributed, resulting in permanently locked funds in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, introduce a mechanism to track unclaimed rewards for paused tokens and allow users to claim them once the tokens are unpaused. Here is a proposed solution:

Add a Nested Mapping: Track unclaimed rewards for paused tokens using a nested mapping:

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public unclaimedDueToPause;
```

Update _distributeReward: Store unclaimed rewards for paused tokens:


```solidity
function _distributeReward(address _wallet) internal {
    if (shares[_wallet] == 0) {
        return;
    }
    for (uint256 _i; _i < _allRewardsTokens.length; _i++) {
        address _token = _allRewardsTokens[_i];
        uint256 _amount = getUnpaid(_token, _wallet);

        if (REWARDS_WHITELISTER.paused(_token)) {
            unclaimedDueToPause[_wallet][_token] += _amount;
            continue;
        }

        rewards[_token][_wallet].realized += _amount;
        rewards[_token][_wallet].excluded = _cumulativeRewards(_token, shares[_wallet], true);
        if (_amount > 0) {
            rewardsDistributed[_token] += _amount;
            IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(_wallet, _amount);
            emit DistributeReward(_wallet, _token, _amount);
        }
    }
}
```
Add a Claim Function: Allow users to claim unclaimed rewards once the token is unpaused:

```solidity
function claimPausedTokens(address _token) external {
    require(!REWARDS_WHITELISTER.paused(_token), "Token is still paused");
    uint256 _amount = unclaimedDueToPause[msg.sender][_token];
    require(_amount > 0, "No unclaimed rewards");

    unclaimedDueToPause[msg.sender][_token] = 0;
    IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    emit ClaimPausedTokens(msg.sender, _token, _amount);
}
```
}
