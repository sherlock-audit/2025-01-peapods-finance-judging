# Pools may lack cardinality, which would make the TWAP useless

### Summary

We use Uniswap v3 TWAP oracle to get the price of any tokens. However these pools may not currently have a large enough [observation cardinality](https://uniswapv3book.com/docs/milestone_5/price-oracle/#observations-and-cardinality) to support the TWAP window intended to be used.

### Root Cause

When our zapper calls `_zap` we can end up using UNIv3 for the swap,

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Zapper.sol#L117-L129
```solidity
                if (_twoHops) {
                    address _t0 = IUniswapV3Pool(_poolInfo.pool1).token0();
                    _amountOut = _swapV3Multi(
                        _in,
                        _getPoolFee(_poolInfo.pool1),
                        _t0 == _in ? IUniswapV3Pool(_poolInfo.pool1).token1() : _t0,
                        _getPoolFee(_poolInfo.pool2),
                        _out,
                        _amountIn,
                        _amountOutMin
                    );
                } else {
                    _amountOut = _swapV3Single(_in, _getPoolFee(_poolInfo.pool1), _out, _amountIn, _amountOutMin);
                }
```

Which would use TWAP to calculate the price and make sure the amount out is priced correctly.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/Zapper.sol#L154
```solidity
    function _swapV3Single(address _in, uint24 _fee, address _out, uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _amountOutMin)
        internal
        returns (uint256)
    {
        address _v3Pool;
        try DEX_ADAPTER.getV3Pool(_in, _out, uint24(10000)) returns (address __v3Pool) {
            _v3Pool = __v3Pool;
        } catch {
            _v3Pool = DEX_ADAPTER.getV3Pool(_in, _out, int24(200));
        }

        if (_amountOutMin == 0) {
            address _token0 = _in < _out ? _in : _out;
            uint256 _poolPriceX96 =
                V3_TWAP_UTILS.priceX96FromSqrtPriceX96(V3_TWAP_UTILS.sqrtPriceX96FromPoolAndInterval(_v3Pool));
            
                _amountOutMin = _in == _token0
                ? (_poolPriceX96 * _amountIn) / FixedPoint96.Q96
                : (_amountIn * FixedPoint96.Q96) / _poolPriceX96;
        }
```

Where we get the TWAP from calling `_sqrtPriceX96FromPoolAndInterval`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-peapods-finance/blob/main/contracts/contracts/twaputils/V3TwapUtilities.sol#L74-L93
```solidity
    function _sqrtPriceX96FromPoolAndInterval(address _poolAddress, uint32 _interval)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint160 _sqrtPriceX96)
    {
        IUniswapV3Pool _pool = IUniswapV3Pool(_poolAddress);
        if (_interval == 0) {
            (_sqrtPriceX96,,,,,,) = _pool.slot0();
        } else {
            uint32[] memory secondsAgo = new uint32[](2);
            secondsAgo[0] = _interval;
            secondsAgo[1] = 0;

            (int56[] memory tickCumulatives,) = _pool.observe(secondsAgo);
            int56 tickCumulativesDelta = tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0];
            int24 arithmeticMeanTick = int24(tickCumulativesDelta / int32(_interval));

            if (tickCumulativesDelta < 0 && (tickCumulativesDelta % int32(_interval) != 0)) arithmeticMeanTick--;
            _sqrtPriceX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(arithmeticMeanTick);
        }
    }
```

Pretty simple flow, however an issue that we will have here is that not every pool has configured cardinality. Cardinality is the earliest value to which the TWAP. Meaning that a low cardinality won't let us utilize the whole 10 or 20 minutes TWAP, but will lower it to only a few, or if never called to the last swap (aka TWAP is not "enabled").

Now, `zap` is used inside `addLPAndStake`, where it is invoked by `_pairedLpTokenToPodLp` in  `AutoCompoundingPodLp`. In short if we follow the flow to the top it would lead us to `_processRewardsToPodLp`, which is used inside every function.

Not having accurate TWAP price means that a user can sandwich a trade by executing a swap to manipulate the price and call deposit, withdraw or any other function which would execute the swap and then revert back to the original price.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. One or more reward pools to be newly created (likely if the reward token s PEAS or any pod)


### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Alice finds a path where cardinality is not set
2. Alice manipulates the pool price
3. Alice calls deposit/withdraw to trigger `_processRewardsToPodLp` and swap out the rewards
4. She reverts back to the original price

### Impact

User can MEV `_processRewardsToPodLp` and steal some of the reward profit from `AutoCompoundingPodLp`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider increasing the observation cardinality for the pool by calling the `increaseObservationCardinalityNext` function on the pool contract with an input amount that is at least as large as the number of blocks within the TWAP window. Also make sure to check if the cardinality is high enough before making the swap.
